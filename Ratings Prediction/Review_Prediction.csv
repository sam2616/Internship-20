4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
4,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .  When you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and featur..."
5,"a god product for students, i'm writing this review after use of 1 month, if you use it only for online class and watching you tube then it's best for you & also its consumes less data if you setting in metered connection. so don't worry about data consumption.  pros- good battery back up & charging very fast, clear resolution screen and it's comes with a classy look  cons- a little bit slower, * It's takes 30-40 sec to open and after open it takes 3-5 sec to being ready to use and the ref..."

3,"Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though.. Don't go for this if you are into high end games. Othe..."
5,"Laptop is definitely value for money!! Also the clock speed is little slow but it works perfectly fine for office work, studying and streaming movies/series!. Good laptop at a good price, also this laptop is good if you are a first time buyer. Just so that you all know...I am writing this review after using the laptop for 2 whole days."
1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
4,"Product was good while delivering... The laptop works slow for first two days now it is ok... I like it... In below 30,000 range laptop,this was worth with windows 10..."
5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
1,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
4,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."
5,"Nice product for normal & jenuine home use only , and value for money. Proud on me for good choice"
5,It's a decent product at a price of 20000. Does the job at the price point. Dont expect it to behave like i5 or i3. But overall good product
5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
5,"Amazing product under this price range. It's stylish design, powerful processor and budget friendly is perfect for basic use. Really thankful to flipkart for delivering this amazing product on time."

4,Good Laptop for Beginners...
1,Laptop stopped responding from today (purchase date 29 Dec 2019)
1,Don't ever buy this product trust me you will suffer later...don't buy this product
1,"I recieved the laptop on 3rd June,after 2 days there was display issue and laptop was getting automatically shutdown and it's taking 5 mins to switch on again.I raised the issue and got the laptop replaced after 25 days.I recieved the replaced laptop on 27th June ,it was working fine for first 2 days and today same issue of blank screen display occurred again along with that there is issue in switching on the laptop as well.Sorry to say,but this laptop brand is below third classüò°üò°"
1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
4,Good
3,The laptop is best in very cheap price
5,"Light weight, much better than expected. Thank you so much dear flipkartüòäüôè 1st day service awsm üëç"

1,"Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy this laptop. It's so slow that you can literally miss whole class by the time it boots and connects. It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications. Restarting this is absolutely headache and just keep seeing the circle in front. Sometimes it appears that there is no processor inside. Bought it for kids online class with basic functionality but my 'chintoo' threw on day on..."
1,"Waste product, always hanging while starting the windows it's keep on hanging, packing also very worst.. Please don't buy the product by seeing the photos and features, going to return the product"
1,Don't even consider this laptop just for cheaper rate. This laptop is a trap in this rate. Just after 3 day use . The laptop now don't even turns on. If by chance it turns on by mistake u can't see anything all blank .

1,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.

2,Very slow processing speed.
1,"Not at all happy with the product as the keyboard is uplifted as in the keys are coming out, it hangs and works very slow while using Excel and inspite of being a brand new laptop it restarts very slowly.

5,Thankyou flipcart
5,Best budget laptop in market.. right choice for students for online classes..
1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
1,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them

3,"Bought just three days ago. Looks okay. Light weight, good display, bigger keyboard buttons. 1TB hard disk in this price. overall great. However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."
5,awesome in this PRICE... looks good.. processor work good.. ram is 4GB & 1TB hard disk at that price is very awesome.. Best for first time buyers.. and college students

I regret for every rupee wasted on it. I was happy that it felt so light weighted to hold, only to realize there is nothing inside üòÖ I request Asus to stop it's production, I guess Asus is pushing unsold decades old Intel Celeron processors. But it's absolute waste of customer's money.  DON'T BUY!"

1,1. Very slow. 2. Audio visual problem. 3. Key board is not visible if sitting properly. One will have to bend the neck and body to see keyboard.

This is sick laptop even for office use.

In this laptop there is baklit keyboard, which gives good typing experience in night and a finger prit reader for the security. There is 14"" antiglare display and tracked is also good and fast. This LAPTOP is good for daily work and also for student.. Number of ports:- 1 HDMI 1 Charging port 1 USB type C 3.5mm earphone jack 1 memory card reader 3 USB type A"
5,"I was in confusion before order, when I received my lappy really loved it. Asus should we go this, yes of course in this process segment fingerprint unlock, compact design, backlit keyboard and superb display etc.. I really like my asus app for getting my laptop updated and healthy. Fast Charging is available. Battery i have not checked but fine decent packaging fast delivery thanks flipkart."
4,"Reviewing after 4 months of use, It's a good buy.. works good for normal use. I only had 2 issues with it: 1. Display has less angles, you can view it from sides up or down you have to angle it directly straight at your face. I think it's a big disadvantage for a laptop. 2. if you want to use it for any audio software it's the worst, it doesn't support a lot of audio features, recording quality is worse than a phone. Even my 10 year old desktop windows 7 PC works way better with way less spec..."
5,After using 15 days I would say product is good to buy. 1. Sleek design. 2. Light weight. 3. Good battery backup. 4. Good performance according to configuration. 5. Sound and display is average. However my experience with flipkart is horrible but rating is given here to product - Asus Vivobook X413JA. I found it value for money and would suggest to go for it.
4,Best compact laptop but build quality is not metalic! Battery backup is good sound quality is descent and display is very bright 250nits
5,"It is as I expected. Light, sleek, compact and decent quality. I really like its white colour glossy finish. I recieved this on 8.03.2021 in 36240 rupees. And I think in this price range no product exist today. And its specs are awesome."
5,Worth purchase for students and who have just lite work .Everything is top notch except the battery I can't say its worst but it is less then the other laptops which are available in this price segment.
4,"The laptop is thin and handy.. due to SSD booting speed is around 6 seconds. The ms office key is not included. Processor fan is close to display ,so you will feel warm . Backlit keyboard is advantage. I dont see in any other model under 38k.  Brought it for 33250 including bank offer and serve the purpose.  If you look for a stylish ,handy and daily use laptop..go for it . !!"
5,"Best Laptop in 35k.. Looks premium and attractive.  Pros:- (1) It comes with 14 inch Anti Glare Ips screen... Which u can not found in any laptop in this price segment. (2) premium design, Good build Quality. (3) Best combination of Windows 10th gen with 512gb makes working super smooth. (4) Hermon Cardon spekars are not so much loud but pleasent to hear...  Cons:- Battery... It has almost 4 hrs battry backup with medium brightness level. Build Quality:- Build quality can be more be..."
4,This is nice laptop and performance are very smooth and looking is very pretty this is a light laptop and i got this in diwali sell and price this laptop 32737 and battery backup around 4to5 hour This review after 8 days
5,"Best laptop for students and working professionals. Finger print sensor is just awesome. Decent battery life. If you are looking for a laptop for regular office works or if you are a student, then you can go for it. But, I've not played heavy games yet."
4,"Camera quality of this laptop is very bad. It is like 1990's camera with lot of bubbles. Even the a 5K mobile will have better camera. If you are planning to use this for video calls as a presenter, then this is not the choice.  Also the customer support is very bad, not able to connect with them through call or chat properly.  Apart from this all other features are good"
5,"Wonderful, nice product. Pros = 1. Wonderful design & build quality 2. Smooth & fast performance 3. Nice Display 4. Backlit & smooth keyboard 5. Light weight 6. Surprisingly super fast fingerprint sensor Cons = 1. This type of blue color. I personally like blue color, but not this cobalt blue. Peacock blue is more attractive than this. I recommend black color of this model. 2. Microsoft word /excel not included, only 15 days trial pack included. This is disgusting. 3. This model comes with h..."
4,"1.Elegant design, light weight , performance is good. 2.Harman Kardon audio is very good but no difference with sonic master or other. 3.Average or say below average camera- maxi 0.9mp HD camera but better than other brand(in other brand generally 0.3 mp hd cam) at similar price range. 4. Battery : max 4 hrs to 4 & 1/2 hrs backup 5. Very attractive coloured Enter key. Like a sweet smile of that girl of a classroom who attract everyone eyes. 6. Keys are soft to press but touchpad left and r..."
5,"First I was very confused which laptop I have to purchase. As I am master's student so I have to do a lot of assignments and presentations. I was searching a laptop which is good enough for all the parameters light weight, fast, good design, decent memory. As I am not a heavy user. For my type of persons it will be best & it is unbeatable. Because 1TB HDD can not beat 512 GB SSD & SSD is very fast as compared to HDD. Laptop boots in just 7-8 Seconds. Best feature is fingerprint sensor. It is ..."
5,Good product by Flipkart and it work so fast and smooth. Battery Backup upto 6 hrs with Internet + Display on use. Overall it was a awesome product by Asus.
5,"The product is amazing and this product is delivered today and i am software engineer and i have a lot of works such as compiling the project and much more work so this is faster for compiling the project dont escape for gaming performance.,,,,"
5,"I have got this for my wife and its perfect for her light usage.  1. i3 10th gen is around 6% slower than i5 8th gen. 2. nvme m2 sdd is an plus. 3. small, sleek light, just like a notebook it can fit in your bag. 4. Harman Kardon (:D) okay, this branding is good for satisfaction. You will not find any much difference when compared with sonicmaster. 5. silent machine. 6. that yellow return key is an added advantage (you know, Girls :p, that is what her colleagues noticed first)  People demotiv..."
3,I ordered the cream color version but got the black one...(one star less for that) **Battery backup is averege **Display is awesome considering the price **Sound output is really good **I assumed it a bit faster in processing before purchasing it(my personal experience) **Built quality could have been better **Have some handy features (one can insert sd card without card reader and so on.....) Overall its a balanced Laptop for students and I got it at 36890
4,I have got this few hours back. The packing was awesome. These features and price is juz a fab combo.the nly thing is u can't upgrade ram. This is perfect for basic users like me. I mean for small programmings n codings. This is not a gaming laptop. This is perfect for average and below average users.
5,Products is very awesome in this price. But battery running time is approx 4-5 hours display is also good . Flipkart deliver this product is delay 2 day after promise date is 18 day . flipkart is very poor delivery service so not buy any product very important and fast needed on flipkart
4,"The laptop features a core i3 processor with 4GB RAM that handles the tasks quite swiftly. Overall a good buy.  Pros: 1. Handy 2. Lightweight and portable 3. Good build quality 4. Good performance in the budget range 5. Good battery life (around 5 to 6 hours)  Cons: 1. Display (although it claims to be an IPS panel, the viewing angles are not good and the display looks pale) 2. Speaker quality is not good out of the box (although it can be modified and tuned later through Asus AudioWizard ap..."
3,1) Display is ok. Viewing angles are not too good not too bad. Under 40k it is good.  2) Battery is not good. Don't expect it to last more then 3 hrs. Charging takes almost 3 hrs from 15 %.  3) Performance is good. Ssd is too good. Boot up timing is less then 7 sec. Performance is also good for normal day to day usage.  4) Camera is ok . Under good light it is better then the rest under 40 k  5) Sound is not loud enough. But the quality is good.the tuning is good.  6) Build quality is good...
4,"Its light, looks sleek, display is awesome (it gives you those matte screen vibes) and performance depends on your usage. If you are a student, perform basic coding and need a laptop for your school/college assignments (ppt, doc etc.) under 40k which comes with a BACKLIT keyboard!! Just go for it!!  Now coming to your main concern, is 4gb ram enough? 1st, yes! It is enough, if you are not editing videos or playing games ( it's not a gaming laptop tbh) 2nd, you can increase the ram upto 12 gb...."
5,"The laptop is very handy and light weight. I have used it for around 10 days and it is working perfectly fine. The battery is not that good, when I have used it for online class and switched on the video, in full charge it gave back up of 2 hour only, whereas if we use it normaly for typing watching movie or pdf reading the back up was about 3:30 hr. Overall I am having good experience with the laptop."
4,"I m writing this review after 2 days usage , Nice product only good for low to moderate usage , battery backup is also good 5hrs (non-stop) usage , Best for commerce student and office purpose . Don't opt this laptop for video editing ,coding as well gaming ."
5,"Extremely compact product. The back lit keyboard is pretty amazing. The keys are very well laid out. The battery back up is decent too. The fingerprint sensor works very well . The SSD makes the computer really fast , which is a huge plus. Definitely recommend if you are on a budget."
5,"Good for it's price range.. and has way better build quality than HP or Lenovo in this price range. Good for simple office task (excel, powerpoint, browsing, etc). Don't buy it if you want to play games. Increase your budget and buy better asus rog laptop."
5,I can tell u exactly that it is the best laptop under 40k . It has all the features a nrml laptop should have. Amazing design and display. Loud and clear sound. Powerful system with no lag. Good battery and charging. Well suited best for me bcz i do online classes and got it with offers in 37k.
4,"Really a good product I felt every feature is ok or good at this price segment Im only disappointed with the size(13""),and its a personal matter only... Else it is very compact and easy to handle.. Worth for the money"
1,"This product is good but due to misinformation, it is not getting attention. first of all this is asus vivobook 14 model. now talk about specification.  Here is some differences from others  Display-display is good, not best Performance - good Boot up time 9 sec only Keyboard - backled keyboard is very good  Not for gaming  Battery - if you are not going to use heavy tasks in it then it gives you more then 6 hours easily. Yes, you will be face disappointment at the first time. ..."
3,"Item has been delivered on 25th. Editing it after 5 days. Even though it is i3, it works pretty good. The only con i feel is its top portion always get dirty and our finger marks remains there like oily. And a Little low brightness. The display and perfomance is pretty good. But feels like too small laptop, because it has narrow side and all. But it is light weight Fingerprint sensor is pretty good.  The webcam is too worse, very noisy and reddish. It is 0.9 MP cam and it is very worse.  Ove..."
5,"*Product quality:*  Booting Process: Very fast Battery: 5-6 hours constant working without charging Display: Good Sound: Not loud but clear and sweet to listen. Backlit Keyboard: Unbelievable at this price. Touch pad: Smooth Heating issue: NO Camera: Sufficient at this price. Ports: Mainly now a days we all work through USB PORTS. It comes with two USB ports, which is sufficient. Storage: It comes with 500GB SSD, in which approx 400GB can be use as personal storage. Rest storage will use for ..."
5,"As far as best product in this price range, 512 gb SSD, keyboard backlighting, fingerprint crips display i3 which is more than enough for regular work and programming.  Really stylish look and light weight"
5,"Good Product but if you are using a bigger size laptop and are going to upgrade to this one then you will feel it smaller. But it is very good . Sometimes it creates some noise due to its fans but it is very compact able and the storage speed is good as it comes with SSD the performance is also average at all it is a multi-purpose laptop.

4,"Its good for daily usage. And light weight. Bettery oerfomace is not good. Perfomace wise, speedy and no lagging. Best option for all if the price is less than 35000."
5,"Light weight, comfortable to hold, backlit keyboard is good, super speed...üëç"
5,Good
3,Everything is good but disappointed with display quality.

3,Display size is too short
4,"This unit is overall good. No issues with performance. The camera is below average but cant rant given at this price point. This laptop is for casual users definitely not for gaming or video editing or content creation. For this price, 8gb ram could have included.  My only regret is that this laptop was not delivered on time. Delivery agent didnt bother to inform proactively, until I reached to customer service."
3,Battery back up is too bad
5,"Overall, good product. Using it since last one month. So far so good. Design, performance and sound are good. Battery backup needs improvement.   For delivery they held this package for 5 days in their warehouse which is just 200 meters away from my home. And their packing was horrible too. But thanks to the packing by Asus, i got the laptop safely."
5,I like this laptop but totally plastic body not feel premium
4,"I am writing this review after 1 week usage. Design is good but i wish they had given white colour through out the body. White and black combo makes it look thicker than what it is actually. I haven't measured it, but weight and thickness is slightly more than specifications but still it is very compact and handy. Backlit Keyboard looks fantastic.  Performance wise it is again very decent. Can easily handle multi tasking, but sadly RAM can not be expanded and it cannot handle heavy games like..."
5,Laptop is very good for student uses i purchased colour white and its not glossy white its off white with a matte shine on it...love the backlit keyboard and speaker is also okay
5,"If u want a small n light laptop for personal use... And if u r not a gamer, this is the perfect product for u. I'm finished with all the setup. And it's good... U can multitask no issue, Sound is on the lower side but hey laptop speaker hv never been for dance music, Display is awsm but viewing angles r not... Told u it's for personal use. Battry backup is decent... Upto 4hrs in modrate use. Camera is good for v-callls.  Overall it's value for money product."
5,Very nice and lightweight laptop.Design and display is brilliant .
5,Average performance but display quality and design are good specially this black color.
5,Good one
5,Very Beautiful Laptop design and performance also good....but this laptop is Small
5,"The build, finish and design is unbeatable at this price range!! Battery is really impressive for the size of the laptop. It is really compact and good to feel and gives uh premium feel. If uh have normal study and work related usage. Surely go for it.!!"
5,Plz Attention Guys... Laptop body totally Fiber Like a Toys Materail Fiber  that is biggest issue at 34000 may just normal fiber body  then All feature r good nd staylish nd light weight laptop look are also amazing  I purchase at big billion sell only price 34000/-

5,"It's good, for normal use performance is good, but don't go beyond normal usage."
4,Great option indeed. You can spend you wont regret
5,Superbbbbbbbb
4,Good buttery smooth performance because of the SSD.  Display is kinda washed out. A bit disappointed with the display.  The pictures by the seller is kind of deceptive. It is way smaller than it seems in those pics.  Booting time maximum 4 seconds üòÄ. Very quick.  Good speakers  Storage can be expanded using micro-sd.  Also Flipkart is not letting me upload pics they might not want others to know how small the pc is actually
5,"Good Product, I am satisfied all of the features, except battery life, It is very awesome product, wheather have a little bits of improvement in battery life time."
5,Performance is good as I expect in this price segment they giving intel i5 10gen with 4gb nvidia 1650 there are no issue with normal use like surfing web and it can handle some heavy application like matlab etc it's good for coding etc. If you are a heavy gamer this will not satisfy you but it suits for entry level and lite gamers. Worst battery back up it stands for 2 hours in normal usage and in heavy usage it will stands max 1 hours. But it's a value for money laptop and in this price se...
5,Amazing laptop. It has a premium and professional look with powerful hardware. Sound is a bit low but I bought external speakers for that so no problem. Everything else about the laptop easily makes up for that. Thanks alot Flipkart for the fast and safe delivery
5,It's really a nice laptopü§©ü§©....I got it for 49k and it's very much worth it...it's has an excellent display.... Brightness is nice...and have a backlight keyboard which is awesome... battery backup 6-7hrs while streaming contents...and while heavy task it's between 3-4hrs for a gaming lap it's far better...u get a 475gb usable storage...wifi 6..and trackpad is awesome...build quality seems to be superb no flexing....even though it's more than 2 kg it's feel lighter.. webcam as like most of ...
3,"So basically, laptop is well and good. But the huge and huge and huge problem is battery. Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop.  Pros - 1. Laptop performance is good (4.5) 2. Laptop display is just ok (4) 3. You will get fast boot time about 6-8 sec (4.5)  Cons - 1. Worst battery (2) 2. ..."
5,A very nice laptop with good display . Also very well performed in day to day activities as well as gaming. Definitely worth for money. Buy it!!!

Display is good Keyboard is good Battery life is also good as of yet üòÖ  Cons: Gets heated up really quick while gaming plus real hot üî• Speaker is average Overall in this price segment this lapt..."
5,"Here is my review on this laptop after using for 2 weeks.  I've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor..."
5,It's very good laptop at this price.  Pros: 1. Very good performance 2. Design is decent. It is gaming laptop but has decent look so it can be used for office and colleges. 3. Ventilation systems is very good 4. SSD is superfast  Cons: 1. Display is good but not best 2. Battery life is around 5-6 hours in normal browsing work.
5,"Value for Money! Amazing Laptop I got! It has mind blowing perfomance, It takes only 8 - 9 sec to boot ! Build Quality is also good...design is excellent ! It is completly made up of plastic but...build quality feels like it has mettalic body ! This is a quick review !"
5,"Best deal in this budget üëå, boot in just fraction of seconds, really very very fast, performance wise it's best in segment, N-Vidia Graphics card along with 512ssd, makes ideal for gaming & other hevy tasks, only drawback is battery but we should understand that gaming laptop consume more power, rest of the things you will enjoy for sure. What I wants in a laptop it has all."
5,"product is good and performance is very smooth for video editings it not so good get upgrade for high graphic games handles smoothly heat management is good battery backup depends on work for heavy use 1hr,40min for less use 4hr for battersaving 5hr overall expereince is very good"
3,"Gets the work done, mid range topper Pros: good battery and processor, less boot time because of ssd, good ventilation, got all the required ports, back-lit keyboard, performance was beats everything.. Cons: heats up too much while gaming and other intensive tasks but not on regular usage, display could be better, keyboard is very compact you need to get used to it, speakers are really low"
5,Great deal at this effective price (46k) ... Just hope the audio output of this laptop could be better and otherthen this the laptop is best in the segment ...... It compete with 60k laptops
4,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.
3,1. Display Brightness is medium & just ok 2. No Free MS OFFICE 3. Weight of laptop : heavy 4. No bag included or any freebies just laptop & adapter is given 5. Performance is good 6. A good beginners laptop 7. I would rate it 7/10 8. No other choice in market if you need a laptop with good graphics at this price range
5,Flipkart delivery even before time loved it laptop has great performance display also great else I'll say after using for sometime battery is also good
4,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.
5,This laptop is really worth buying üòö Sound is average but display is good üëç Performance is also superb üëå Boot time is also fast üî• Battery backup is also not bad actually . U can live with it !!! Must buy
4,Battery and Sound could have been better. Best performance under 60k range

Soooo much smooth gameplay , heating issue is actually normal. Not sooo much heating trouble. And the only thing you have to take care is, don't play games without charging. Because, battery don't have the tendency to withstand games like rdr 2. It'll only last upto max 1 or 1and a half hour. Trust me ....I got this lap on aug 3. And..."

5,Look n feel of qaulity is not bad it's impressive. Ppl saying build quality issue not at as usual like every mid range laptop. Bit look is on professional side rather than gaming one that's good touch. Speed is quite good but they could haven't to provide extra storage slot.

You can't hear anything with your ceiling fan turned on.  So be prepared to get a bluetooth speaker with this laptop.  For me 3 hours battery life is okay but the speaker output is really bad."

5,Nice üòä
5,It's a nice and decent laptop in low range.
5,It's a beast laptop but only 1 thing I don't like is in keyboard center it gets hot n left n right side will be cool. While continues playing slowly the hotness spreads to left or right. But except hot . It's best for 12 hours gaming + steaming live.
5,It was a very great laptop in this price battery also very good around 5 to 6hr performance awasome display also good better to buy 50k below
5,All are good but bettery pickup little bit low and besign is bad and deficult to carry 2. 15 kg Anything good üëç very speed Worthwhile i like it's a very good product
5,"There's only one con and that is the battery. If u r ok with a battery backup of 2.5 - 3 hours, simply go for it. Heating issue will only be there when u r playing at a very high settings. For normal uses u don't have to bother for heating issue. I loved the product. A beast in such a good budget. It has only ~10 secs of booting time."

5,"I wonder why nobody posted pics for snow white variant. It looks super awesome. Ok for those who are wondering whether this device is just for students and kids then answer is NO. It's equally great for productivity and office work. Crostini (Linux apps support) is awesome , it opens up whole new possibilities of having Linux apps along with Android apps and Chrome OS extensions. Battery backup is unbelievable and this has to be great due to low power and efficient mediatek chip. If you want ..."

5,An amazing device especially for high & smooth performance. Online classes goes well.. Touch & type makes it more effective & efficient. Worth buying :)
4,"Received it yesterday.  It has a 100% plastic body. Touchscreen works well. Touchpad is also great. Boots in seconds. It has a port for USB type-A where you should be able to insert a harddisk/pendrive or any USB device, but unfortunately you'll have to do that forcefully as the port is very tigh/small for those devices. It has a USB type-C port, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a slot for memory card. I have used it for around 9 hours and approx. 50% battery is used. It has 64 GB RAM, the OS occupie..."
5,It's a great laptop and delivery was very fast but the box condition was okay but laptop and other things inside the box were great and I am using this laptop working properly and battery backup is great and laptop is very fast and it's easy to carry because it's slim and light weight thanks Flipkart üëçüëçüëçüëç keep it up
4,"Best for 1. Online classes , Zoom meetings, browsing and the reason is because of its portability, excellent battery life but the camera quality is just average for video conferences. 2. You may not get the best typing experience but better than many windows devices which is almost twice the price. 3. Chrome OS is light weight and also supports Android Apps. Google will definitely comes with better desktop experience in future. It also providing updates till 2028 4. Build quality is fine fo..."

Pros  1 Very trustable solution in this price for online work load. 2 within 1sec synchronise your Android phone üì±. 3 Very light weight. 4 ..."
5,"An awesome product from HP at this price.  The Laptop looks great & is very light to carry. Plus it has touchscreen. The performance is good for basic use, it handles multiple chrome tabs & apps easily. Battery is the best thing here. Easily gives more than 9-10 hrs of battery life, depending on use.  The Web cam quality is also decent at this price point. The sound quality is also decent. You get 45 gb of storage of this device (as system uses the rest).  The touchscreen is responsive &..."
5,"Bang for buck. Just go for it, Only one con which can be sorted.  I have purchased a windows 10 celeron laptop from acer years back, it is too slow to use because windows can not perform without good hardware.  Chromebook is perfect choice for this less powerful hardware for casual use, Netflix, Zoom/Google Meet classes & browsing etc all works perfect without any lag. Also no heating issue, very slim & compact form factor  Pros: - Apps from appstore is a huge plus. - touchscreen is a huge pl..."
4,"Having used this device for about 10 days, the difference between a smartphone and a laptop gets even more blurred! This is not a power workhorse machine and it is not designed to be one. But it sure is a great asset for simple daily activities such as surfing, emailing and some conferencing from home. Display is so-so and hence if that is important for you, then advise to go for a higher end laptop. But for this price point this is a very good buy. If you need the experience of your Android ..."
5,Very good purchase. Really worth the money. Battery backup is very good almost lasts 2 days in simple average usage. i.e continuous usage of 12 to 14 hrs. Display is bright and it has anti reflective surface which is quite good. Good processing power for daily average usage not for pro users who play games or do some stuff on their pc as apps are not optimised on play store to support big screen. Apps that run in landscape mode in mobile runs very well. Good for students to take classes a...
5,"It's my first chromebook. Worth to buy, great battery, great display, average performance sometimes it disconnect from wifi automatically but get resolve after resetting. Overall great experience. If you watch movies, online test series and general surfing, then this is great choice for you"
5,Very good and easy to handle. Purchased on special price. Total cost 16776/- very good resolution. Good battery life. Fast charging.
3,"Battery life was too good ,Display and working also good, But small in size. Sound quality is ok than i expected. Weight less easy to carry Over all Good. I have worked this product for almost one month i really like it. Use for students."
5,"Simply awasome the product. Thanks seller very good packing, its best for office work and as well as student for online class, this chromebook 3 times more fast Windows. Value of money product. I give 5 star."
4,"Best laptop for kids online class. Good performance, touch screen is good. Battery is good.  Some drawbacks: 1. Full volume in speaker is creating noise sometimes. 2. Some of the android apps dont work properly due to font and other issues(which is expected 3. Price should be 22K only."
5,"Very good product in this price range for official work like online meeting, file editing, creating files, watching movies. Battery backup is outstanding. Design is very good. Thanks to Flipkart for so fast delivery."
3,"Product is good according to me in the following aspects: design, battery, worth for money, portability, performance. It is attractive as well in terms of its aesthetic. It‚Äôs best suitable for students who attend online classes. However, it‚Äôs not compatible to take online classes and android applications are not working as affectively as they are in an android phone. For everything we need Internet connection."
4,"Bought this for my kid's online class. I'm very pleased with the performance. Boots up under 10 secs. Setup is easy. I used it for 4 to 5 hours a day. A full charge lasted my 3 days. Certainly suitable for online classes or light browsing. If you are a avid Windows or Mac user, then there is a learning curve. But if you have used android tablets, then you can get hang of this pretty easily.  The only drawback is the camera resolution, its bit pixelated, better use it in a well lit room durin..."
4,"Good for your day to day task like browsing, watching videos and attending class online. Cons: 1- Display is not great, just average 2- Speakers are not loud just ok  Rest all is good like 1- Battery back up , charges via type c fairly quickly and good backup. 2- Day to Day tasks can be done easily, slight learning curve if you want to use short cuts (videos available on YouTube to help) 3 - Compact and portable  With bank offers got it for around 19k decent for the price.."
5,Excellent laptop for online classes and watching videos on apps. Super light and portable. Very easy to configure and download apps. Lighting fast. Good cam . Display could have been better (4/5) Best buy in this price (17400)
3,"15 hrs battery backup...excellent small cute usable laptop.  -ve points.. 1.flipkart not mentioned but after purchasing i came t know that it is 32bit system. where as now 64bit is dominating the market and 32 bit being obsolate. 2..mkv fromat may play with out audio, proper video player or codec missing 3.google docs ,google drive etc available ""online"" & ""offline"" but offline mode is too slow and bulky , not for real work."
4,"It's a good product....it's speciality is battery which lasts for more than 10 hr per day,fast booting, display is good but some drawbacks of this are it has only one usb port and it's speaker sound is low ...but it's a good product due to its low price and good performance and good experimental product where hp uses mediatek processor in a laptop.... all together in my opinion those who want to use laptop first then obviously go for that ...but this laptop is for light work not for gaming....."
5,"Battery is awesome. Easily lasts more than 2 days for an average work from home situation. Quick touch response. Not so good camera.  In Zoom app, pencil feature is missing. For MS office we have to purchase to use the features.  However, satisfied for my regular work. Value for money product."
5,"HP 11a Chromebook has hit many sweet spots as an affordable and functional device that can function beyond online education tool. The chrome OS is refreshing, fast and simple to use. Remember few useful shortcuts that can be accessed by just typing ctrl + alt + / that actually is a shortcut to open the shortcuts chart. One could also explore the Chromebook simulator on Google that helps in preparing to use the Chromebook.  Office apps such as docs, sheets, presentations are very comprehensive..."
5,"Very good product..it served my purpose, I could use MS office online version for free on it.. Very feasible to carry, good keyboard, display quality, And the Very user friendly OS..I could not use Qbasic and Logo in it.. except this everything else is perfect.. I am a computer science faculty for a reputed school.."
5,Very good for online classes. If you want full fledged laptop look elsewhere. This is exclusively for simple day to day work and some entertainment. Speaker is below average. Other than that everything great for the price point
5,"Its awesome. I am too much happy. Rrally its wonderful. Perfect for my daughter. Camera, touch everything is too good. Really i m loving it. Thank you so much to flipkart and the seller"
5,"Nice and very fantastic product, I had received it some days ago ,it has high battery backup almost 10 to 12 hours nice touchscreen display and it has fast charging speed as it take less than 1.5 hours for charging ,at this price this company is not available in other websites or app , thank you flipkart for keeping this type of product"

5,"This is something that students need for their online classes , playing mild games and browsing . If your budget is in this range then chromebook is the best thing you can ask for . Touch response is also good . One thing that I don't like about this device is the placement of headphone jack next to the charging cable . Rest it is a very nice product ‚úÖ . Go for it üëç"
5,Outstanding product. It's compact and feature-packed and it's not too heavy. The functions are also easily understandable for kids so they can do their work on their own. Just Wow.
5,It‚Äôs a chromebook. Great for basic tasks. Can install VS code and run python (under Linux Dev mode). ARM processor makes it great for android emulation. Touchscreen was a surprise. Chromebook benefits not available in India so beware of that.
5,Works as expected
4,Good one for student or normal works. Microsoft office is missing. Hp can give options for the same so that it's more helpful for students. Plastic quality must be improved. Overall in this price range it's better than tablet for student. It's fast. Just didn't like that is camera quality is low for online classes. HP can release any appropriate software to improve the same.
5,The display is far more better than a full HD TV. Touch screen is perfect to use. Very fast and smooth processing speed. Two days battery life. Boot time is just 3 seconds
5,"Best for study. Can play games but as the display is not that good, satisfaction level will be low. If one needs a laptop for studying only and watching films at times, no need to spend 40k on windows laptops, it is the best. The best part is that it supports almost all the apps of Google Play Store."
4,This is good for kids.. The system is fast and simple but Speaker quality is not good.. USB port is not suitable to fix.. looks like local toy. This is made up of low quality plastic.
5,It‚Äôs performance like premium laptop Battery backup is very good Handy Volume is low Speed is very fast Value for money Word and excel is only the problem Finally amazing products

4,"Good product for students. This is not a heavy duty machine. But for zoom classes, email etc basic stuff this is one of the best. Camera is average. Too light laptop easy to carry . Go for it if you need laptop for basic stuffs."
1,"This is a 32 bit OS machine, please be noted about this fraud hauling of review and media report, everyone is telling 64bit OS but mine it's clearly seen 32bit."
1,"This is a compact chromebook good for the online classes for kids, however it is highly straining on eyes. My son has stopped using this just after two days as he complained about eye strain. I tried using this for a couple of days, and I could experience the strain too.  If you can't see the screen then this is useless."

2,"Touch sensitivity is extremely poor and I have to press and hold hard at times to get the screen's attention. This being one of my important criteria for performance, I am rating this laptop low.  On the other hand, the laptop boots up within 7 seconds and shuts off within 2 seconds - this is really fast.

4,Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding. Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it. Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag. Sound quality is good

4,"Front camera can be a bit better, Apart from that for 11k , u get a beast of a phone No competition for this price , 18 watt for 6000 mah battery , Helio g 85 , 128 gb rom 4gb ram , looks good in blue color , clean U.I. I LOVE IT FOR WHAT I PAIDüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,This mobile has good features but battery doesn't seems to be an that much good performance though having 6000 Mah others features are great and display is awesome gaming performance is also good as well so overall nice phone and only big draw back Narzo should start giving silicon case which is not provided in the box.  Basic need to protect the mobile.

1,"Utterly disappointed...I was excited by seeing the battery is 6000 mah and camera 50 mp but actually it's below average performance and it takes very long time to get charged fully and if we Google any website it's not opening, really it's nightmare for me, I feel like the company is cheating by giving wrong features"
5,Good product but display only should be full hd+
5,Nice
5,Mobile is best battery backup but charging is slow .3hour time taken in full charge
5,Nice product
5,Good......
3,I don't know why company has claimed the camera is of 50 MP. It's as good as 20 MP only. Rest of the things are good but not according to price. In that case Samsung phones supersedes the realme with the same price. I am little disappointed to opt it.

4,In this price sigment it should has Full HD+ display but it is only HD+ and processor g85 . Overall okey. Not too good.
1,This phone camera is not a good quality üòîüòî
3,"Literally, camera sukcs!!!! Realme accidentally added an extra 0 in front of 5. Making it 50MP instead of 5MP. Front camera also not good. I am using realme phones since laat 4 years , cameras are always their major buying point, but narzo 50a has it as a greatest drawback. Rest all things are as per specification shown. Overall good if u can neglect camera ."
1,Selfie camera is very bad
5,Nice üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç i.m happy
1,Very low buffering speed Poor performance Low speaker volume Don't buy this phone. I regret within minutes after buying this phone.
1,I'm really disappointed with camera performance it's not 50 megapixel camera it's like old VGI or 1.3 camera worst product..
4,Awesome phone..but slow charging
5,Very nice / didn't thought I would get this get this in good state but got it
1,"The worst product narzo could make, overheating, lagging and what not. over and above this, pathetic support from flipkart. just calling daily and rejecting replacement daily. Now the return period is over and i am stuck with this useless hot brick perhaps can be used for ironing my clothes."

5,Good phone I'm SO happyü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
4,"Everything looks good except slow charging. In today time realme in launching a mobile costing Rs. 14000 without fast charging, it's surprising. Although realme claming it 18 watt quick charge. Such a big charger, but charging so slow üòî"
5,Good dailyvary at the time and the dailyvary man is helpful...I am Happy and satisfyüôÇ
5,Fingerprint sensor are slightly upward from its normal position so when you try to touch the sensor you'll feel like you are touching camera (but you're not touching camera) except this the phone is good and 128 GB storage is a plus factor in this budget!
1,"Not Expected For Realme, This Mobile Slow Work.. Not Perfect.. Camera Bad Quality.. Some Time Hang out ..Better Going Other Mobile Or Other Brand."
3,All the reviews you have see on flipkart is fake only made by offering some cashback or coupon discount. I am very disappointed with front and back camera both in low light. This is also not upto the mark. Battery backup is good. Overall performance is more than good.
3,Good
1,Worst Mobile I am taken worst photos in this camera I am not see within half hour this mobile because mind is distributed and eyes are too disturbed. Battery performance is good. Battery charging is too much time I am requesting to other members please don't by this mobile

He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything.  The performance is Stellar.

5,"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

The phone is great and has perfect camera, security and performance is ver good of this phone. No lack at all. Battery backup is good you can spend a single day without charging it. Size is perfect as iPhone 11 has same screen size but diffcult to carry but this device is light and perfect in size. I give 4 star because they don‚Äôt other accessories now with iPhone."
5,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.  I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
5,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.  1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far 2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use 3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X  Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.  Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

5,"I really m glad that i went for i phone in place of all other android devices like the Samsung S series nd one plus . Also , m amazed by the battery life in this i phone . Single charge and its last for a day easily .. Even the gaming experience was great"
5,"I got my I phone 12 in just 2 days of order, Thanks flipkart for delivering it faster.  Pros: Super faster than previous version Display is amazing Speaker is absolutely perfect. It gives very classic premium looks.  Cons: Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra. Cost is very high. Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."
5,Product is very fantastic i am just love it. Display is awesome. Performance like buttery smooth. Iam android user before 6year but never experience like this performance. You can definitely go for this. Due to late delivery i give only three star.
4,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
5,Awesome phone ‚Ä¶ value for money.. Happy with battery life.. Awesome camera features‚Ä¶ look at the images snapped using the phone‚Ä¶ easy to use.. Just feared about getting scratch at back glass‚Ä¶ but using cover helped it‚Ä¶
5,The brand is very trustworthy and i got genuine pice at a very low cost.I ordered the green one and trust me the colour was amazing.All the colours but specifically green and purple are nice for look.Thanks to flipkart‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone. Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
5,"Guys ,this is just Beast at Every Aspect of Configurations, Full Pack with What You want, Like Best Camera , Best Display, Best Battery for whole Day Use, And Everyone know About Processing Speedüëå.."
5,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
5,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it‚Äôs very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
5,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."
5,Thanks flipkart i trust you got my device perfectly loved it best phone in it's segment
1,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don‚Äôt know if the problem is only with my device or its general,..."
5,"Top class performance and battery backup too. Charges quickly if u are using a 20w charger. Night mode is good , HDR mode works flawlessly. VFM phone."
5,I got my product after 10 days from my ordered date but never mind finally i received my iphone 12 its crazyyyyy Trust me if you wanna have any handy Handset and high performance within your budget then you can go for this Its truly Unbeatable
5,Best in every department. ‚ù§Ô∏è I upgraded on iPhone from Samsung S20plus and after use almost 10 days I realise that it‚Äôs my good decision.
4,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment. Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.  Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.  I will start with....."
5,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.  Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.  Thanks for quick delivery."
5,Super fast delivery by Flipkart. Ordered my iPhone 12 (128GB) on 20th Oct and got Delivered on 22nd Oct. Mobile received in perfect packaging and Open box delivery also gives a sense of security of our Money.  Good initiative by Flipkart. Hope we get more products with Super fast service and Open box delivery. 100% satisfied.
5,"Pros: - Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me. - Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android) - Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours. - Square-shaped design co..."
4,Such a great phone with great features‚Ä¶excellent camera and display‚Ä¶.decent battery life .. value for money phone ‚Ä¶beast like processor ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è You can go for this without any hesitation ‚Ä¶ if u want to use a phone for long term simply go for this (128 gb) ‚Ä¶
5,"Perfect phone , Apple after all Go for it eyes closed if in the budget. Camera best quality, crystal clear photos and super stable videos at 4k 30/60 fps,best slow motion in the phone ever. Performance : best then any android (even 1+ 9 pro ) Battery life last for a day use anyhow. Super smooth software experience. Topnotch security level üíØ Very lightweight to hold."
5,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.
5,"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User üòÅ"
5,Best mobile phone ever‚Ä¶..just go for it‚Ä¶..excellent battery life‚Ä¶.no issue in battery‚Ä¶.display is mind blowing‚Ä¶.sound is like jhakkas‚Ä¶.everything is perfect‚Ä¶i will mention one time more very nice battery backup‚Ä¶whole day n more also‚Ä¶if u use wisely your phone with proper settings‚Ä¶.worth the value‚Ä¶and thank u Flipkart for fast delivery.
5,Using apple after 3 years last I was using 6plus and after that S8 iOS is good if you are in this apple ecosystem otherwise I will ask everyone to stick to android Camera is really good on this one Speaker quality is amazing Performance top notch Battery life is fantastic it will last full day in heavy uses
5,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.
5,Save few bucks and buy this and avoid 13. Used this for a year and great compact beast if you got money to waste else restrict yourself for under 30k androids. Not having great of everything but still best as it got everything you need in top notch phone.
4,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
4,"Delivery is super fast, after using it for 2 weeks, camera quality is superb, very smooth UI, compact and very light weight. 1st week everything was good, but after that auto rotate feature stopped working and eSim calls disconnecting frequently, contacted apple support but issues not yet resolved."
3,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks. Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
5,My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios  Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.  Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.  The display is gorgeous. One of the best.
5,"First thing is I need to thank the seller for giving the original iPhone 12 for such a great pice. Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.  Now coming to the packing ,it was packed well and no damage was there. My old Samsung phone was exchanged for a good price and was also picked up by them.  I am really enjoying my first iPhone. Battery i am getting o..."
4,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me! I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats. 1. Picture gets pixelated when you try to zoom in even after 30 to 40% of actual image 2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seco..."
5,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..üí≠‚ô•Ô∏è
5,"Worth the money invested. My first iPhone and it could not have been better than this. The look, the ease of use, the security and the display+camera it's just awesome."
5,Excellent phone... And flipkart delivered it perfectly the packaging was very nice and was properly sealed and product was 100% genuine...
4,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it‚Äôs üçé, didn‚Äôt like battary backup though, with heavy usage can‚Äôt survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."
5,"If you are first time ios user u are surely going to miss few things frm android but the sense of security u get frm ios is unquestionable , and about the device its upto the mark the screen is so fluid that u will love it and battery optimisation is also top notch all the games i hv tried run buttery smooth so if u are ready to compromise on some features u can definitely go for it"
5,As always awesome product by Apple and Nice timely and safe delivery by Flipkart. First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal
5,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
5,"Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along. At this price customer expects that.  Nothing else to complain about. It is very good looking, compact and light weight. Master piece from Apple."
5,"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review Pros 1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable 2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di..."
3,I am switching from Android to iOS after almost 8yrs of android phones usage. Overall I really liked the iPhone 12 due to its seamless high quality display and greater performance.  Pros: 1. Display quality 2. Performance 3. Great features/inbuilt apps from iOS 4. Camera in good light 5. Build quality 6. User friendly interface  Cons: 1. Heats up very fast after few mins of camera use and gaming. 2. Battery drains very fast within few hrs of continuous use for WFH so you need wireless fast c...

5,Appreciated with product!!!!!! It's amazingü§© when I ordered there was so many doubt related products quality and refurbished Or duplicate... But when it was reached its amazing experience. Phone was fully packed as it bought from showroom...... And same with warranty... Warranty is in accurately activated by system... Very good product
5,My final review after using it for whole one week. Awesome Was a Hard Androider but as I switched really loving iOS Know. Guys the product is geniune please those who are saying flipcart is fake and all. Belive me it's an trustworthy Family. I thanks My seller and the entire team of Flipcart Thank you so much. Regards.
5,"Finally got the most awaited iPhone 12 with favourite white. With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in. Well it was a great deal with Flipkart, off course I got the the phone in two days after placing an order. It‚Äôs been a few weeks now using iPhone, it‚Äôs different experience altogether. Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."
4,Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren‚Äôt bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn‚Äôt hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.
4,Definitely an awesome product...an awesome experience if you are upgrading from android.... Bgmi experience is unmatched... The performance and day to day activities on the mobile is way different than any other can offer.... My suggestion is ..if you can afford it....you may go if you are a lover of quality over quantity.. Battery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours.....
5,Good experience iPhone 12 mobile Camera clarity good quality Battery full charged 1 hour Display quality good 8k Overall mobile is good Flipkart Fast deliver 1day
5,I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.
5,"Upgraded from Iphone X. If you are in Apple ecosystem, this is a good phone to upgrade. I'm glad I chose this phone 12 over 12 pro. The extra sensor and lens in pro is not worth the extra 35000 IMO. The delivery was perfect and right on time! Thanks Flipkart!"
5,Received my device today and I must say it is AWESOME. Delivery time was just 16 hours and it was nicely packed. The camera and performance is top notch. Night mode works superb and the design is flawless. I will provide detailed review after few weeks of usage.
5,"I really liked this new design of iPhone , there's no compromise when it comes to performance and quality of apple products and flipkart service is great that I got this delivery in just 3 days thanks flipkart and thanks apple delivering this great device, liked it so much"
5,Awesome as always. Started journey with iPhone5 and used all the models till now. This latest model is again awesome and fully loaded with features. Really love it.
4,Front Camera at low light doesn't give a good result at all. Looks Cheapest Camera ever. But in light it does work good and about other things its just Apple. A Perfect Masterpiece. Very light Weight device with Quality Look.
5,Awesome product‚Ä¶ Camera: it‚Äôs superb. Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use. Display and design : perfect. iPhone 12 is looking so premium and best till date. Performance: perfect and very smooth and premium. Colour: i prefer Green because it looks more light green and different than others and ofcourse it gives premium look‚Ä¶ 2nd option can be white. Flipkart order : firstly I hesitated to buy from flipkart as it is of bug amount but I ordered and got my phone one day ...
5,"My first switch to the iOS ecosystem, been a wonderful with experience. Glad it was with Apple iPhone 12! Great product absolutely loved it."
4,Camera pe perfect. Screen is good but smaller then the other smart phone which are half on price. Price was good on big billion day but not on diwali sale. Don‚Äôt understand the point of buying the charger saprately.
5,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones. Would definitely recommend to both iOS and android users. Good enough cameras, nice display with slim and ‚Äúequal‚Äù bezels, overall a really great experience"
5,So I got this phone for 69250 the 128 gb variant batterly life is superb charges fastly camera is very very good performance is top notch display is also very nice over all a good phone
5,"Review after 15 days: Upgraded from iPhone X Excellent phone with amazing battery back up, easily last a day with high usage. Fast charging is also great. Charged 30% to > 80% within 30 mins. Not to mention Camera quality. All iPhone have great camera quality. But upgrading from iPhone X, this phone‚Äôs camera quality is even better with better crispness and great in low light. LED screen is pretty awesome. You can get great pictures and videos steaming. Design is pretty awesome. Flat edges..."
4,"Overall a good phone but camera is not as it was hyped. May be software update can change the camera quality. Specifically, the portrait edge detection is not at all good. Other than that the build and finish is excellent. Display is very good. The phone is responsive. Overall a very good phone but not a phone to be priced above 60 - 65K for 128 GB."
5,"Well i returned back to iphone after ip7 because original is original and no one can replace the same.  Whether in terms of usage or performance , features iphone excel in all of these.  Phone Audio quality is best and no phone could match that pure natural sound , you will love it  Rest phone display is excellent OLED with 460PPI text and videos look amazing and built quality is very good.  Now most important part that no other phone could match is its software. Both os and apps are very goo..."
5,One of the best phone I purchased. It is good to invest on such phones. It is a fantastic product. I love using it.
5,"It‚Äôs powerful performance Good choice to buy, But display should be full Screen like Samsung Amoled.. Go for it , Gd quality HD pictures u can click.."
5,"Once an Apple user always an Apple user! Started off with an iPad and the experience with it lead me to buy an iPhone ..... It‚Äôs on a different level ... luxurious phone from a luxurious brand .. Be it camera quality ,stereo speaker , full OLED display , night mode ,A14 bionic chip performance, very light weight and so on .... we can talk all day about this iPhone ... A perfect masterpiece !"
3,"Spent around 50k, the phone is beautiful in every way but it has some serious flaws as well.. Camera doesn't have pause button can you imagine? While incoming calls you cant get option to reject the calls.. calculator doesn't have history option.. no pro option in camera though video and photo quality is top notch. Found some very unique features and love them but still finding not worth 50k phone.."
5,"Thanks to the delivery person, he was awesome and help full. He unboxed the package in video recording and we checked whether the product is correct and not having any dent. To Flipkart customer care 0 star, since they are dumb and will only reply copy paste message. To product, what to say it's an iPhone.... Over all the product safely reached out, I would suggest to go with while or green color as they look awesome. For longer usage, as I generally do not change iphone I went for 128 gb..."
4,1. Battery drains very fast. 2. Photo quality superb. 3. Cannot migrate from android to ios. Move to ios app is not effective and good. 4. Android is far better in handling. 5. Power adapter was not provided. Got it after 01 month from flipkart (separately purchased). Till now charging with my Samsung A50. 6. Overall not satisfied at all.
5,"1. Got my phone within 3 days after placing the order. So before time delivery which was good. 2. I have purchased Blue colour iPhone (128GB variant). I was confused with which colour to buy and finally purchased blue colour which looks amazing. 3. Overall feel is excellent and quite handy to use with one hand and also very light weight. 4. OLED screen is definitely a big plus. 5. Speed, Touch screen, Gaming experience is really good. 6. Switched from Android to IOS, initially took sometime(1..."
5,"Blazing Fast experience with Great Camera quality, light weight and super handy with superb Call quality. Iphone 12 is a Must buy!"
5,The flipkart delivery was good and the delivery guy opened the pack in front of me as per the steps described. He also asked me to check all the checkpoints to identify if phone was in a good condition. Iphone 12 is amazing and had a good battery life. Lasts 1.5 day with normal use and 4g services shut down when not required. Has a amazing processing speed
3,"Overall good mobile, apart from so called big brand, nothing special in it. Camera is gud but not wow like Samsung s21+or ultra which I am currently using. Yes performance is really top class. You will not see any lag. Battery could have be better."
5,Best phone best performance Best camera perfect Brand light weight Best screen in class
5,Got a genuine product. Checked the serial number online as well and it all matched. Works like a charm. Fast as ever. Worth the money
5,"Great Product from Apple. Go for iphone 12 however if like to invest 40k more for one more camera, 180 nits brightness difference (which you cannot differentiate b/w both of them) and slight design difference then go for iphone 12 pro.  Otherwise iphone 12 gives you all the features which an individual wants in a good phone."
5,"Bought it for 49k approximately on big billion days , absolutely love it, low light daylight selfie every camera is brilliant , performance is extremely fast and smooth , beautiful finish , I bought black color but i think purple is best color"
5,One of my best buy on Flipkart as well as my first iPhone. Just loving it more & more. Big billion day sale was deal breaker for me...‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"The name says it all, iphone. Absolutely love the phone was a bit skeptical about 64GB but it is more than enough for a minimalist.  It was a worthy upgrade , thank you flipkart"
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY‚Ä¶.. Awesome battery life. Camera is top notch üî•üî• Display is good Audio output also good . In case of performance it is a beast no comparison. BGMI runs super smooth. IOS experience is awsome super smooth. Buy 20W apple charger fast charging is superb üî• This is my first iPhone and I just loved it üòç Thanks Flipkart for deliver genuine product.
5,I liked the display and performance is very good and I purchased it in big billion offer. I got it reasonable price
5,Upgraded me from iPhone XR. It feels like an upgrade for sure. It approx 30gm lighter and the overall experience is flawless. Anyways nothing more to say about Apple as a brand. :)
5,"It's just awesome It's gonna feel it's worth every penny Performance n cameras r just top class This is my first apple device , I have been using Android past 10 years....n I just love it"
5,At first i was sceptic to switch from Android to IOS. Then after all the research and reviews I bought Iphone 12 and i can assure it is absolute pleasure to use IPhone and camera is just masterpiece. The right decision at right time.
5,This is the best iphone to buy compared to 12 pro. Black colour is way better than blue Screen is quad hd and not full hd which is found in samsung s21 plus at the same price range. Rest functioning is buttery smooth Face id works like charm Don‚Äôt worry of smudges as they are not that prominent if u are looking at phone directly but in 12 category i think you should go for only this colour option besides white. Matt sides are good for handling and there are no smudge problem there.
5,Excellent battery life - for non gamer like me and great camera received the product in 24 hr of ordering without any extra charge......Amazon asks for extra money for same.....thanks Flipkart
5,"Everything is superb and the most I liked in this phone is its Design and Camera and coming on battery life, it is also perfect for me lasted for more than one day as I mostly use my phone for surfing and sometimes for watching video. Really ‚ù§Ô∏è it."
5,Excellent product and excellent prompt service by Flipkart. iPhone 12 is value for money phone and Flipkart made it possible in big billion day sale. Offer the same Kind of discounts on Apple AirPod pro in coming sale.
4,"Everything is fine can live without a higher refresh display but the battery life is not satisfactory.batter life could be better to make it a perfect flagship, moderate to heavy users need to charge it twice. Overall a good product."
4,"Much hyped... Good for a BBD purchase 51k, usable for a normal user.. Got it for my wife, she loved it.. Personally, Android flagship model user, love the SD 888 performance... Can vouch for the iOS, nothing superior if you have proper hardware.. hope apple support will be strong... Go for it if you love the brand gimik..."
5,"I am writing this review after 1month!! First of all I would say that this is totally overpowered phone. As I am a gamer I hav youtube channel so it's really support all high level games. I have done streaming also its run smoothly. But battery should get more as I have to charger daily at 2 times(heavy user!üòâ). Its really support my work. Really a most powerful phone with A14 bionic chip, greatest chipset for 2020 to 2022 as I think because it is the winner chipset in 2021. I will highly re..."
5,It‚Äôs a very light phone I totally loved the performance of this phone Shifting from android to IOS has some initial challenges but now I am use to it its a perfect fit phone in hand Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day. Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also.
5,"First time I purchased a smartphone on Flipkart and my experience is awesome. I received genuine product and delivery of product is within time frame. I‚Äôm an android user and first time switched to IOS, iPhone 12 is up above my expectations and happy to have it. I got a great deal from Flipkart. Thanks Flipkart team for blast past fast deal."
4,"Ok here‚Äôs the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice ‚Äòwhy apple, you could have at least added this‚Äô is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That‚Äôs not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it‚Äôs an amazing phone. The best so far."
4,"Seriously I didn‚Äôt the camera quality better, I was using 6 and now moved to 12 but 6 camera quality is good in terms of worth of the product however overall product is really nice"
5,After switching from 6s I realised the super phone is this one iphone12. It‚Äôs display feels like a liquid with the finger swipe. Awesome to avail with an offer.
4,Got it for 53K. Upgraded from Oneplus 7. Good software. Very smooth and lag free. No heating issue while using. Video clarity is really great. Battery is good for one day of heavy usage. I used to end up my busy schedule at 6pm with around 30% battery  Compared to Oneplus 7 still camera is lack of colours. I felt like all photos washed out of colours. Front camera is really bad. Display also lack of good punch in terms of colours. My Oneplus life was really colourful in-terms of camera an...
3,Just brand value. Andriod mobiles much lower than this price gives better features. I bought this phone for camera but compared to other mobiles like oneplus 9 and nord iphone does not give better images. No optical zoom.
5,i really loved it but apple should give a large display like 8plus i had switched 8plus to 12 but m not really happy wd the size
5,"Upgraded after 4.5 years of using iPhone SE, although the older one is still adequate for day to day use, the battery and camera started to bug me. I wanted to get a new phone that can be used for another 5-6 years and it could only have been an iPhone. Looking at the battery degradation over the time, 12 seemed like a better option than 12 mini.  Coming from a budget unit to a relatively flagship one has been a great experience.  Pros: Cameras, Display, Usability - gestures are way more int..."
5,"Yes yes yes, I was planning for 1 year to purchase a good iPhone but fortunately I got this iphone 12 (128) Variant which is beyond my expectation, only 51 k with the charger. Thank you Flipkart to provide me a super opportunity to get it owned."

3,"Not sure if FLIPKART would dare to keep this review. But if it clicks,then good. I won't review about iPhone12,because its my waste of time. We all are smart enough to watch videos rather than reading reviews here for iPhone. Review (For your safety): Make sure you keep all proofs especially video, while opening the box and initial check like dents,scratches etc etc within hour of delivery.  Why its required? If you share photo or make delay in informing,you will realise that no one in the wo..."

5,"Pros :- Great Performance Great Camera Great sound quality for calls Great Display - Finally OLED in the non pro phones  Cons :- Battery life - Although iOS is very optimised, still could have been a little better Price - Not value for money as compared to other android phones  For existing apple users don't update if you're coming from iPhone X or 11 series. Won't feel much of an update For others, buy it if you're looking for a change from Android or if you're looking to get into the apple..."

Thanks to Flipkart, device was on 72k, added to cart got 3k discount and I made the bill 1 lakh for which 5k icici offer got applied.  I'm not going to review the phone, obviously tons of youtube videos have them .

5,i am using this iphone12(black) since feb 1. i am so happy. iam enjoying so much with this. i loved ur service. no fake delivery i got brand new iphone. the function of this phone is super. the only one thing which make me feel little bit sad is its potrait camera becoz of lacked telephoto lens. we cannot take zoomed potrait photos. in my view 2x zoom sholud be given in potrait mode according its price. AT LAST I WANT TO SAY THNKS TO FLIPKART AND ITS TEAM FOR UR FAITHFUL DELIVERY.
1,Never Buy Phone from Flipkart. i got the Broken Iphone12.

5,"Well always being user of Apple devices doesn‚Äôt makes my think about something new. As everyone knows the things remain same but the way things are advertised are different. But the things had changed now. This new iPhone 12 should be bought with all the MagSafe accessories if you want to enjoy this technology beast. Be it camera, performance, multi tasking or whatever a smartphone can do, this thing does it better. Go for it."
4,Retina is not good than samsung galaxy s21 ultra

I‚Äôve started exploring and capturing candid and uploading too on social websites. Before this I used to little hesitated but now have confidence.

1,Fully disappointed About this phone

5,Awesome. Only display should have more refresh rate as I used one plus 8 before which have more refresh rate.
5,Awesome product
4,Awsome
5,"I upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus, So it a bigger and better screen with smaller form factor ratio. I miss touch id specially in pandemic time but face id solves the purpose most of the time. I bought 128GB variant and the difference from 64GB and 255GB is -10k and +10k which means apple is charging too much for 64GB storage, that means its not value for money exactly.. However buying a 64GB variant is a trap as you will need to keep on deleting data only."
5,"Got the Phone at 75k. Been using iPhones for the past 5 years, and they never disappoint. A must have for iPhone lovers."

5,"The overall purchase experience of Apple products in Flipkart has always been great compared to other e-commerce platforms with tons of negative reviews. Received the package in perfect condition (one-day delivery), one will get the same feeling as expected from a retail store while purchasing. Did not find any red flags considering the price of the product where one tends to be more cautious with the condition of the product received."
1,I have purchased iphone 12 through Flipkart billion sale and its been only 10 Days my phone is not working its screen is totally black out and phone has switched off . I have never faced this kind of issue in any new phone that to only 10 days.

1,Defective product
5,"No need to mention about the quality of the Apple products. I brought green colour iPhone 12, which is an excellent colour. I am attaching the Snaps taken from my iPhone 6s Plus.

5,Authentic Product from flipkart‚Ä¶ Missed the sale value but got it with a good discount after 2-3 days of sale‚Ä¶ Loved the phone but yes the battery is not much good and a earbud is required if you are planning to buy this phone as you will be irritated by talking in headset or in speakers

5,Loving the phone. It gives premium experience with all the apps and devices connected to it  Thanks to Flipkart to delivering it so quickly.
1,heating issue in phone. worst Iphone 12 ever
1,worest product cheating people android is best
1,Battery of my new iPhone is really bad. It hardly goes on for a day even with a screen on time of 4.5 hours on an average. Expected a little bit better battery life at least for some months.
5,FIRST TIME I MOVE TO ios ..... to be frank first two days my mind came with thought that why i waste my money on it. but later on i loved it..... there is no compair of android to ios. compairing ios to android like you compairing Rolls Royce to Maruti SUzukei
5,Having Best Cameraüì∑ & iin hand feel‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòò
2,The battery life is worst
5,It‚Äôs Just Awesome. Way better than iphone 11 pro.
1,Many problems like as battery üîã and camera üé• and hanging all of thing it‚Äôs to bad in this prize
5,No doubt Look and Feel is premium which gives you different feeling when you put out it from your pocket Camera + Display + Battery which is very less in numbers but actual performance is far better than 108MP camera + 7inch Display + 7000mah battery Pricing as usual is very high even if it is purchased in sale moreover they don‚Äôt even provide charger earphones back cover tempered glass even booklet is of single page
4,"i am giving one less rating as the phone which was provided to me was kept in storage for long and the sticker glue was starting to set on the mobile, plus the mobile was having some dust after unboxing it.  Apart from that all the things seems to be okay and as expected applish"
5,Loved the product.. only back camera quality is not upto the mark
5,If u want ever green colour then u can go for black colour
1,Heating issue. Don‚Äôt buy.
5,Iphone 12 is just love. I switched from iphone 7 to iphone 12 and this phone has hell lot of features. Looks are classy and elegant. Camera quality is amazing not doubt samsung s21ultra have better zoom camera than this but the feel you get while having a iphone and colors generated by its camera processor have no comparison. Little bit costly but when people praises its display and camera quality every penny spent on this feels justifiable.
5,Nice
1,Low quality Colour Issue  Do not by online üö´ iphone  Please üôè Do not üö´ by
5,Super
1,Worst product. Batterry backup worst.

5,Very nice mobile looks like a very good very fast performance
5,Only one word for this iPhone #fantabulous ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üëå

4,"Mobile in hand fill is good like a premium, Camera not so it's just good, Battery backup is very good, Performance is very good."

3,Bang for buck at 57K. Bought the product during big billion day sale 2021. Performance is amazing. No lag at all. Camera is excellent during the day. But I expected more in low light shots.

5,Alhamdulillah my first iPhone Thank you filpkart timely delivery
5,Nothing to Say. It‚Äôs a power pack in n performance and alrounder in almost all aspects. Bought it in Big Billion Dussehra sale at 55k. Only thing is it heats when charged with 20w charger that too if sorrounding temperature is also higher. I think it‚Äôs usual.
4,Upgrade from 6s it is blazing fast. Camera is not so good as they claimed for night picture battery backup is 6 -8 hours continuous work with high contrast

4,"Needless to say anything about the iPhone. It sure comes with a price range but if you have invested so much of money then there is no point of giving any negative feedback for obvious reasons.  Though just wanted to point out the delivery segment that flipkart delivers. The delivery guys are the worst.

On-time delivery, multiple calls from support team to check on the product. Aa for the iPhone 12 itself, it‚Äôs a classy one, got a beastly upgrade from my iPhone XR. Good performance, camera, battery (for now); even though facing slight heating issues while charging the phone"
3,Phone is average performance & battery continues using only 4-5 hours working
4,After using 10 days I found apple iphones are premium phone lookwise and from every angle.i shifted from Android to this phone and first time buyer of apple iphone.i experience Android phones are more user friendly rather than iphones. Although I'm satisfied after purchasing this phone.
5,This is my 5th since 2013. The Biggest enhancement is in the Display and speedy Smoothness.
1,Hiting my iPhone 12 and Cemara quality not perfect
5,The phone is awesome but too highly priced because of the brand. Bought a phone first time on an online platform. I was very scared till I received the phone in my hand. The flipkart team was very helpful as they helped me with all my queries.

5,"Finally a complete phone by Apple  This phone will do everything you need your phone to do and more. The screen, the camera, speakers, battery, build quality, in hand feel, all are consistently good.  It's a no non sense phone which is also future proof, thanks to the A14 chipset and 5g support.  I wouldn't say its cheap, but apple is infamous for that. If you can afford it, it'll not let you down."
5,Provided in excellent condition by seller truecom.. 2 day delivery. Thanks for making it a smooth sailing transaction Flipkart!!
5,Bestest phone I have seen Ever....
5,Flipkart really provides a very good service. Rating for their service- 5 star  For product- I say just after 1 day i am not happy with IOS. Very hard to use OS. Android provides much better features and ease-to use
3,It's just ok.. camera is not as good as people say It's not worth spending huge amount. Build quality is good.. looks ok.. screen is good.. battery worst..charging speed poor Usability ok ok..
1,"very poor sound quality, i am very disappointed to purchase iphone 12"
1,Worst inbuilt features comparing to android Bought it for iOS apps development as there was no other way.. do not waste your money in this
1,"One of the worst product..Heating issues in 1 day..Don't buy guys, Go for other brand.."
5,I ordered this phone for my boyfriend He loves it Also everything is just ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Flipkart is worst service and don't buy any products from flipkart...  Please don't loose money and waste of time here buy the products
4,"Apple Phones are always overpriced, if you like apple logo backside your phone go for it otherwise 20k, 30k android phones are equally good."
3,"About Flipkart & e kart it‚Äôs worst delivery ever during big billion day. About phone after using 10days not great everything is. Average Display, Medium Dolby sound battery back up was half day continuously if we use,overall average impression."

5,I upgraded it from my Redmi note 5 pro > iPhone 12
4,upgraded from iphone 7 good phone but overpriced
5,Eyes closed BBD Deal for 128gig model at 50k? Best deal ever. Need nothing more to say about the phone. A god tier product with an awesome performance and cameras. You know apple is apple. What am I here writing a review for?
5,Good product Good camera
1,Size is less then display .üò°üò°
1,Camera issue
4,Phone is good but if you using Samsung flagship like s10 s20 note 10 do not buy iPhone you will disappointed Samsung display and front facing camera is far better.
4,Nice camera
4,I was using realme x7 max before purchasing iPhone 12 but honestly I want to tell one thing that iPhones are overhyped and nothing I don‚Äôt feel any upgradation from my previous phone but compromised from many aspects. So please don‚Äôt waste your money for a false status and choose an good android phone and invest your rest money for your better future.
5,I ordered this for my friends he is very happy and he say it is the lowest price of iPhone 12 he thanks me very much and I thanks flipkart to give me some pocket money I am a student and I earn my pocket money from shopsy
3,It‚Äôs fine not that great
2,phone is getting heated while charging  for 100% charge is taking more than 80 minutes  Finger print is a lacking feature.  Front camera is not upto the mark
4,Go for it you won‚Äôt regret. You‚Äôll love it if you have used 5s ‚ô•Ô∏è
1,Not as perfect that I heard it‚Äôs quality
5,Awesome üî•üî•üî•
2,Battery is the worst I‚Äôve ever used with any phone till date! Also the phone heats up a lot! How come Apple do this to it‚Äôs users?
5,Now I realised why apple products are costliest. The fell of using iPhone is seamless. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Well
3,"The phone‚Äôs battery is not at all comparable to One Plus. Comparing with 9R. The charging is very slow even with genuine 20w apple charger. And battery drainage is much higher.  FYI, I am a normal user and neither I have not yet installed any game, nor I am a heavy video viewer or something. So, even normal usage won‚Äôt give more than 20 hours anyhow‚Ä¶ Apple is betraying customer in this aspect!  Rest other aspects are 5*"

5,Had an amazing experience using iPhone 12 iOS optimisation is far ahead of android Beast phone with awesome a14 bionic chip Great camera Doesn‚Äôt lag in bgmi Ram management is superior Must buy
5,I am very happy with the performance.It would have been if you had added charger & finger touch sensor in mobile.
5,"I had been a hard core Samsung fan for years now and I finally decided to switch to iPhone. Being addicted to the super amoled screen and punchy colors of Samsung, it took sometime for me to adjust to the screen. After using it for 2 weeks, i feel no regrets for switching to iPhone I became a big fan.  Pros: The performance is really smooth. Decent battery life for a moderate user. Good camera  Cons: The only issue I have noticed is - there are challenges with Network connectivity for which ..."

5,This smartphone is very good in camera and battery And value for money from Samsung with clean and smooth Ui and good battery life also
4,First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone
5,"Pros:- Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation. Samsung brand is trust. Phone is Durable and service centre are very helpful This is myth exynos are not good. Trust me, in real life in doesnt matter until and unless you do heavy gaming at very high..."
5,"Best mobile for in this price range, Battery backup is highlight. Better go with this mobile in budget category from best brand. Absolutely perfect mobile."
4,"Nice phone. We can rely on Samsung than any Chinese company like MI, Redmi, Poco, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc.  Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb. Not has SAmoled display and you can't expect it in this price. 6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.  But the Charger is of 9V and there is mentioned that it is of 15V.  It did justice with its price. Value for money and trust of Samsung.  If you are willing for it, Go ahead üëç"
5,"Camera is good battery is good fingure unlock sensor is very good and fast it is very thick due to large battery this phone is not for slim phone lovers but phone is very good and price are also good , good job samsung"
5,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.
5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous. As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ..."
1,The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.  Now with cons (there are multiple) Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull. There is over brightness on display...
5,It's fantastic phone actually . Especially battery backup is very good upto 2days with a single charge.. it's nearly 1/4 kg.. Anyway best phone under 12k
4,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive. Camera quality is good in this price point. Performance is also good in this range Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it. Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it..... Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it."
5,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.  ‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.  ‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.  ‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.  ‚Ä¢ Overall, I love this phone. No complains."
5,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof üòç Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user. Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that. Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one. In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG."
5,"Though the camera quality is not too good , based on the battery , display and performance the phone is a nice one .... I hence recommend to buy this mobile as it's worth of the money .... And thanks flipkart for the fast delhivery"
4,Overall good camera and battery phone in this price. Camera quality is very good. Battery also good last upto 2 days. Performance good like any other samsung mobile. Sound quality is very good.  Phone is little bit heavy due to 6000mAh battery. Back panel looks outdated.  Overall good phone in this budget range.
5,"Best clean budget phone. If you need a clean. And good simple degine working performance. It's best. And if you need best of the best photo, then plz buy a DSLR not a phone."
4,"Low light camera is not good , selfie is average but looking wise it's a good product . Performance is good with average gaming Battery pick up also good  Overall value for money"
5,"Go for it if u r not a ardent game lover like pubg,cod. 4 out of 5 for this budget range.  Good build quality Pros: Definitely the battery. It's real good Display looks good. No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly Back camera is good.  Cons: Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range No back cover. Even simple one. High wattage battery, but atleast takes 2hours to full charge."
5,Really amazing üëèüòçproduct I'm totally satisfied with it if anyone is willing to purchase a new phone I will recommend you to purchase I have also ordered another same product for my mother it's really nice u can rely on it value for money üí∞
4,"Amazing smartphone. Camera , battery back up , display , are awesome üëå. It has a little bit heating problem but not at all . Amazing smartphone for students becoz I'm using as a student .üòäüòä. It is heavy also , this is a bad point for this smartphone. But all good . ND I'm satisfied . Delivery was also good üëç. Thanks flipkart. üòä"
1,it's not very good but battery is good processor is not very good so if we have to do gaming then it is not better for us
5,I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.
4,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .
5,It is a good quality product and it is better then my expectations....... It's a cool phone. As it's a med range phone..
5,"Very nice product according to price. delivered next day after booking. Camera, battery, display good. Every one may buy with out any doubts. I recommend it to Samsung lovers. LOVELY MOBILE."
4,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.
4,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI
4,Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended
5,This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative
4,"Great Product , If You want to buy a new branded phone and you have only a less amount in your hand , then no problem just buy this and use its fantastic. I Bought a Black one , that's great in real but not good in photos..."
5,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.
5,Fabulous budgeted phone. Use to gift üéÅmy wife she is very happy with this fantastic gift and amazing performance. 5star to this mobile and Samsung too‚ù§.
5,"I gifted this to my mom on my 1st salary from my 1st job. She's really happy although she wasn't very positive about the cost. She believed she could use a cheaper one. Now, how do i tell her that nothing is more valuable than her love."
3,"Listing out only most desirable points to know from realtime usage. Others you'll find on online reviews.  Pros: Efficient battery. It doesn't go well with gaming though Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress  Cons: Mediocre camera for this segment. At this price you'll get awesome image quality from Mi, Realme and others. Sound ..."
5,"Nice Phone in samsung budget series I love samsung products quality , after sale service , the support, security updates all in all great company ...."
5,"Superb Phone......  Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.  Pros: 1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage 2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use. 3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good. 4..."
2,"When I was ordered it is M12 , but I received F12.I don't know why it is happened and what is the difference. Camera clarity is very bad. My redmi Y1 13MP camera clarity is far better than this M12 or F12.I was purchased due to 48MP camera."
2,"Awesome product & I have ordered this product on the 1st day,its performance is good & battery is also good,its look also good but this model similar to galaxy A12, M12."
3,"Very good Shape nice battery, performance is okay. overall value for money. It will be great phone if it gets better display and speakers than this"
5,The best phone among all on this price range Camera is awesome. Battery is monster. Everything is just perfect. So happy to buy it Thank you Samsung Thank you flipkart.üëç
4,"A nice product in affordable range. After Using Vivo, Redmi and Micromax , which boast of good Camera quality and attractive accessibility options but finally ends in software/ hardware issue, sluggish performance i have returned to Samsung after 3 years. Camera quality - good Display - good Performance - good except sometimes there is issue in call connecting . Battery - good as well as fast charging. Face unlock- slow Fingerprint unlock - average. Overall, recommended for purchase in th..."
5,"Literally the best of Samsung in this price range.  Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK. The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark. The selfish camera is better.  Battery lasts upto 1 day even on continuous use but it takes time for charging.  It is not recommended for gamers, but for a regular user or student who uses for attending online classes, calls, multitasking, It is highly recommended.  Display is amazing. Adaptive 90hz display is very s..."
4,"Best mid range mobile from samsung , back camera is good but front camera is avarage. Performance is good although good phone in this price range."
3,"You use it as a secondary phone not primary And the pros are 1 big battery 2 big storage 3 processor is all right Cons 1 display not that good 2 camera is ok not upto the mark 3 audio is not upto the mark You can go for micromax in note 1, it's far better than this"
5,Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not ...
5,Selfie camera is not much good as expected. Main camera is ok. But the rest of all the performance is the best I loved it too much. The 90hz display performs like pro. Very very fast response of screen. Battery lasts whole day long for online classes. Overall it's a beast in this budget.
1,Display is waste even less budget phones of other brands compared to this have good display.....camera says 48mp but trust me it's not even 8mp camera also.....speaker volume is less...... never expected this from a brand like samsung....... samsung manufacturers the display and supply to all other brands but Samsung itself should work on his phones rather....... totally bad experience. Please go for any other brand......if u buy this phone simply u will not satisfy.
5,"Bought this as a second phone. Was looking for a cheap reliable one. So went for a Samsung phone. Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good. Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use"
5,"Very well balanced phone - Camera, Battery, Display & Antennas - best in this budget. Additionally, an excellent software experience!"
3,"Camera is not as per expectations,there is nothing like 48MP quality in clicked images,performance of front camera is also not good. Performance is good in this price range,battery is awesome and display is ok."
4,Review after 3 month of use:  1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5 2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5 3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5 4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5
5,I had bought it for my children and they liked it very much.. Its worth every penny.. Absolutely a smart buy in this price range.... üëåüëå
5,"Awesome phone in this price. Performance is very good in each. Battery backup , camera and storage all are fantastic. Thanks samsung and Flipkart for this. I recommend to buy samsung mobile."
5,Super valuable phone I like this phone I am so happy thank you flipkart ...
3,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phoneüòá. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome üëå"
1,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people."
4,Product delivered on time. Phone seems good right now but it is heavy maybe due to big size. Charging takes a lot of time but the battery backup is good. I am satisfied with the the product but not delighted.
5,Very nice mobile phone...I am feeling very happy after received this product.... Camera is well ..... And thanks to flipkart for delivery in very short time a carefully also....
5,display and camera are way better than chinese competitors in this range. people writing review like they are paying 50000 bucks. i got it for 8549 and under 10000 this is best you can get.
4,"I loved the part of delivery from Flipkart and a good phone in this budget especially when it is NOT CHINESE and MADE IN INDIA.  For a regular use, this phone is nice with good battery and camera.  Just 1 star is less because, it feels thicker than expected. Rest everything is perfect."
2,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features. 2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing. 3. No hitting issue.   4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use. 5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.  .. . ....NO APP LOCK, NO COMPASS. ......  üß∏ APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN."
5,It is a very good and velue for money smart phone....... best quality camera and best battery as well as bast display in this price segment ant it has exynos 850 it is a good processor of all rounding üëå i use this phone continues 2 months and i really impressed it's service . It has Android 11 with one ui 3.1 . One ui 3.1 is a extremely good ui and my one of the favorite ui . So i extremely suggest you this phone
5,It is a super phone in this price range . It camera is good. Display is good. In first time the battery Is not in function in after 2 days the battery is very good. In full charge it leads in 2 days . It is good performance and good quality . Display is good . You will buy you'll happy. In this price Samsung galaxy F12 is better than anthor mobiles
4,Poor camera. No night mode. Nice lock app not supported. Rest is good like performance and battery life. Software experience is great
5,Phone look is awesome best suited for official use ...Firstime#samsung Thank u filpkart for speedy delivery
5,"The camera is just wow,battery is obviously good,the performance is great,the display is really good a very smooth feel,it's good for gaming,and you get samsung max with privacy protection,vpn and stuff and it's samsung so as a brand too samsung is really up there plus it looks really good so it's definitely perfect for avg users and gamers."
4,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality. Volume of the phone is very low. music or videos cannot be enjoyed and we can't here properly if speaker is on during call. Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it."
5,"Samsung f12 best build quality,heavy battery life,Knox security, advertisement free system,no heating issue,fast charging,no lag,unloacking very fast,90 hz display is more better than full HD display of Chinese phone,Dolby atmos audio...I think samsung show their build quality in their phones in all segments...must buy ...flipkart deliver boy is nice ..he waiting for me 3 hour...and good delivery ..thanks flipkart"
4,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.  Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad ."
3,"Pocket friendly but not exactly pocket friendly. Other words it's great value for money but due to 6000mah battery it becomes think like 90s mobile phone. I think we don't need 6000mah battery as any way we are home in this lockdown. Apart from phone thickness everything is just awesome, perfect blend of memory, display and cpu. Awesome display. Samsung you rock always."
5,Good and fantastic and very happy and lovely mobile
1,Like it's camera is is like 48mp. It's take too much time to charge. I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung . It's has very less features. It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter. It's screenshot taking method is worst. It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete. I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG.
3,"If I am going with brand name SAMSUNG then it should be like super but in samsung f12 disappointed me . It's camera quality is not good ,it is 48 mp camera . If anybody want to buy this for thinking good camera I recommended to go with Realme. Battery backup also less ."
4,As per this rate its good deal for me. I like it because i am not heavy user or gamer so i like it. Display is Little bit not because its not Amoled display.
4,Overall Satisfied üëçüëç  Pros: 1. Big Display + Good build quality 2. Sharp Colors 3. Good battery backup lasts for almost 1.5 days 4. Smooth touch + clean UI 5. No lags until now + no heating issue 6. Rear camera works pretty good in day light  Cons: 1. Front camera is average 2. No back cover provided 3. Feels little heavy in initial days but later gets used too it.
5,Review based on 2 weeks usage. Good phone overall. Decent camera. Good display. Very good battery backup. Samsung product query support claim gorilla glass but do not explicitly mention on their website.
4,Good product in this price range but not so good for gaming ...brilliant camera..and nice performance overall nice mobile...
2,Camera is not good as campare to sumsung M20 And m11 Mic receptivity not good Not good product on this range
4,"Got this for my mom..infact the first ever Android based Samsung phone brought in my history.  Good things:  1. Feature set like 90hz display, Samsung pay and Samsung Knox support, Dolby Atmos support and even Widewine L1 despite HD resolution is good. 2. Excellent battery life. 3. Decent RAM management. 4. Good update timeline. 5. For 720p display the viewing angles is decent.   Things that could have been better: 1. Slightly better Exynos chipset would have been good, but no lags felt prob..."
4,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it. Camera performance is also average. Not so high not that bad. It's Not perfect for Photography lover. And Yeah it's little bit heavy. Weight is around 240-250Gms.
3,Display is ok ok..as compare to AMOLED screen.Other things like battery and hardware performance is perfect..4gb Ram and 128 gb is nice combination..Overall phone is good in this budget.
5,Wonderful product... good battery life.... nice display.... fast biometric... over all the product is worldclass but they should improve camera quality...# value for money
5,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent"
4,"Phone was delivered per time frame..... If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change Other than that there is nothing else to post If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO"" Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11"
4,"I have never had a good experience with Samsung mobile before.So I always use a different brand of mobile.After reviewing of all good,the Samsung F12 galaxy was bought.  Quality of product & finishings too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easy accessible.Light weight.  The quality of pictures taken from all rear cameras are very good.But not good results of front camera with compare of different brand.  And also thanks to flipkart for very fast delivery within two days."
5,Very good product. Value for money. Battery back up is strong. Awesome display. Sound quality is very good and loud.
3,"Product is average, kind of old age phone. Its good for mom and dad who has less consumption of Social sites and cameras and generally have phone in bag coz its 221gm will be able to tilt your pocket. True Feedback after 2 months of use. Pros:- 6000 mah battery 6.5'' display Con's:- Bad Processor, very cheap Bulky Poor camera 8 mp is better than this Samsung claims 48 but in one specific mode no zoom.low light performance horrible. I won't recommend this phone to people out there."
5,This review isnt for mobile because i just received and too say something it is little but hurry. But the commitment the Area manager fulfilled of Jassola Location ( South Delhi ) is remarkable. I just received a phone within 24 Hours due to Birthday of my younger brothet on Next day after order placed. Thankyou very much for the instant service and a delivery person a most humble person. For the only reason i am aplus member and retained customer of flipkart since 5 years
5,"It's very nice budget phone under big brand Samsung, Camera performance top level Hardware performance top level Screen size and its view amazing to watch anything with big this big screen Battery backup really very good Multitasker, easily run 6/7 application at same time and use simultaneously which is really good from samsung Very good budget friendly purchase so if you're thinking to buy don't think just buy it"
4,Good budget friendly device from Samsung specially packed with that 15 watt charger which makes it far better good in every expect if u are thinking of purchasing a phone for your family go for it without anh hesitation
5,"A fair bit of bloatware on it that needed to be removed. Otherwise oneUI is a decent interface, not a lot of lag. 90Hz display is a bonus for my mother who consumes a lot of content on it. Good purchase for the money."

5,I bought this phone for my mom...and previously She had a Techno In 1 smartphone..and Techno has the worst software We have ever used...I don't choose Realme and Poco as Galaxy F12 is secured by knox ( although no Samsung Pass and secure folder but those are additional features and Having knox always means it's securing data from thefts and vulnerabilities)....Front camera optimisation is very good..Rear camera is okk..but Samsung India should optimize that too..90hz is fine...no issues with ...

1,"Don't buy this mobile, it has a display issue. samsung company and flipkart have no response about this. My mobile display got blurred within a week."
1,Wifi doesn't work. When I raised the return request it was cancelled.ekart person without visiting the place provided comment that product mismatched. I am still stuck between ekart and flipkart. Such a horrible experience.
5,Flipkart is offering good service and sending good products. I am happy with Flipkart.üòäüòä
5,"Awesome product , its camera quality is so good, its battery performance is also very good. it is overall very nice.üëåüëåüëå"
5,"Best mobile phone for in this price range, battery back up highest, very very nice mobile üì±"
1,Overheating issue. You use for 15 mins and phone will get overheated. Very bulky you will feel like holding a brick. Battery charging will show you time of 2hours 40 mins and even after 3 to 4 hours it will be charged only 50% to 60%. Also feel like at some place touch is not working properly need to click twice. Finger print sensor also useless rating 1 star only. Poor product.
1,poorest picture quality
5,Biiiiiiiig Battery
1,Received a used product and when I'm requesting for replacement flipakart is not responding. Bad experience with flipakart. Customer care will put call on hold and disconnect after some time.
1,"Camera quality so poor .  Not as 48MP ,it's like 8MP.so improve quality samsung."
1,"This is a really bad phone. The quality of the camera is pathethic. It says 48MP but honestly the quality of the camera is not more than 4MP.  If you are looking for a phone with good camera quality, please dont but this. I have requested multiple times Flipkart to return the product, but rather than answering their call centre disconnect the phone."
3,Samsung Phone Build is good. 4/5 Camera Not good 2/5 Performance Below Average 2/5 Samsung OneUI and Security 4/5 Phone Weight Too heavy.
3,Camera quality is very bad when comparing with redmi phones. Performance is good. Worth to see it as 4GB Ram. No 5GHz wifi available. Have to live with 2.4Ghz only. UI is not impressive. Need to go for custom launcher to get rid of this ugly UI. Speaker sound is very low. Headphone effect is better. Fast charging charger is not as fast as redmi charger.
1,Front Camera quality is very bad üò≠
5,All thing is good but camera is not good because no beauty pluse add
1,Front camera very bad DISPLAY IS NOT AMOLED VERY BAD QUALITY  JUST FOR A CALLING U CAN BUY THIS PHONE

It's a perfect buyer harrasment."
3,1.Touch is not much fast. It's slow. 2.camera is good. 3 battery back up is good. 4.Display touch some times it not work twice or thrice have to touch. 5.charging is slow it takes 2.5 hours to full charge. 6. Once charge battery back up is very good.

1,"I am using samsung smartphones since 2012 and this is first time samsung disappointed me. Before this I was using Samsung M20 and M20 is far better then this phone. Even M20 5000 mah battery is good and long lasting compare to this F12 6000 mah.  Camera - below average, sometimes it didn't open and take much time to save image. Too much lag in Camera.  Battery- on paper it's 6000 mah but it's not even working as 5000 mah battery, charging time 2.5 hours to 3 hours and 15w charger is a joke on..."
1,Horrible product Dont fell in trap
1,Very very worst camera quality display quality is very worst cell performance is too low
5,Nice
1,Worst seller this product
2,Worth if you buy in 9000 in 10000 it's OK but in 11000 they fool you. Display is bad camera is OK but speaker sound is very poor if you play song in speaker it's sound like old China mobile.
1,Waste mobile in waste flipkart
5,According to this price range very well
5,Value for money..  It is a perfect mobile for gift to your parents or non heavy user family members. It's little bit heavy but with 6000 mah battery. 90hz rate IPS display is comparable to amoled screen.
5,SAR value is high
5,Camera is not that much excellent but good enough. Apart from this its superb !

Didn't expected that much poor display and camera from a brand like samsung, even my samsung J2 (5yr old) take far better selfie than this . the only good thing about this phone is battery backup, otherwise i feel totally waste of money.. Not at all recommended for female users..."
3,"Ok for the money.Not bad.Only best thing is battery.For 2 days no tension about charging.Camera average, display average, processor average.Big draw back is charging speed.Very slow compare to other brands. Atleast 30w charger is required for this huge capacity.Best for average usage.Not good for gamers,photo enthusiastics."
5,Value for money product
5,good product awsome
2,Camera is so dull Samsung f12 is not 48mp camera It's a 5 mp camera It's cheating with me
3,"The camera in the day time is superb, but where in the low light conditions is average, and the display is good and it is value for money"
1,Complete wastage of money. Display is worst. Cannot read screen due to extra whiteness. Screen movement slow. May be due to processor. Camera is worst. Samsung made fool . It's a complete waste of money.. Flipkart should arrange for replacement with better mobile with extra cost if a customer need. I am facing thermal throttling with my phone after using it for few hours with light usage. As this phone uses a powerful chipset this is not expected to happen.

4,Nice product and it's too features at this price
3,"Initially, I was not reviewing the phone but I thought I must give my opinion. The phone is good but not the perfect one. But, It can be chosen in this price range. 1. Finger sensor given on the edge becomes a difficult task to unlock the phone when it is covered by silicon cover. 2. 48 mega pixels are just to say, actually it doesn't perform as per 48MP."
4,Good
3,Finger print scanner should be in the phone. With 48 megapixel camera no night mode is available and quality of photos are not as expected. Overall its an average phone.

2,"You will not be the owner of this mobile. Samsung will be the owner. It will install all kind of applications without your permission from Galaxy store. You will get a hard time to update simple apps from Google Play Store like chrome, android system web view. Its better to choose a stock android mobile than any Samsung these days. The One UI is full of bloatware."

5,Good
1,Phone is bulky also front camera is worst.  Nit even guven tempered glass with mobile. Almost all companies are given the same.   So before order orser temper glass as well because tuff to have tempred in lockdown.  Also without temper glass riak of breakage.

2,Wrost mobile phone in samsung brand
1,Camera bad quality as compared to 48 pix heavy weight please don't buy this product. Performance low
4,It is perfect in this range of price.
2,"Writing this review after using for 50 days. Speaker grill damage, sound is breaking. Samsung is now degarding its image as i've been coming across many cases of samsung phone where issues are been observed within 6 months. People suggested me to not buy a samsung phone but i had that trust factor but they betrayed. Hope Samsung maintains its quality and trust in People mind because word of mouth marketing has huge impact on brands"
5,Display Quality is little dull type because it is not a full HD display Smartphone it's a HD . When you watching Movies or Shows You Observe the Quality of screen.And Other Features are awesome. Because of display Quality photos look like dull that we think camera is not good but actually CAMERA IS BEST
5,I thought Samsung's camera quality would be very good but it is very poor. I have done a lot of stupidity by taking this mobile. It would have been better if I had taken another mobile better than this. I didn't expect this from Samsung
5,Its an average phone at best price
5,Perfect mobile under budget
1,Don't waste your money on this.Everything s***s in this phone.if you press on call it will take 50 sec to start call if display of page is large display breaks slow performance lots of bugs in tge software no value for money.Avoid this phone
5,good
2,Phone is too weight. Camera is very worst.
2,Always phone is hanging.. I don't save any files in my phone also
1,"Worst purchase ever. The voice breaks evry other second. We cannot complete any conversation without reconnecting 3-4 times. Tried with 3 different service provider sim, and the same sim tried on different phone to compare. It proved its the phone fault. Its a complete waste of money"
1,"one of biggest worst phone ever in my life, bad camera, bad picture quality, hanging problem and within a month of buying the phone is dead, so friends, do not buy this phone at all.such a bad phone that i don't have words to call it lousy."
5,"Mind blowing Really happy with the product. Camera quality is awesome. Battery backup is also good. Overall, I am happy with the product."
5,Nice fone
5,"I am regular user of Samsung mobile instead other Chinese mobiles. Nice phone in this price segment. Its been more than 2 month buying this phone and didn't find any error. Runs smoothly! If you are planning to buy this Go for it. If you can spend a few more penny, I would suggest Samsung F22 which is newly launched :)."
3,camera performance is good and battery is best 5/5
1,Waste of money
5,Good phone
1,"Speaker sound is not good Tons of pre-installed apps Only useless apps Worst software optimization & ram management I have seen in any samsung mobile Heavy ram usage by system itself 4gb ram variant is left with only 1.4 gb free ram , when the mobile is first setup  Just copied Chinese manufacturers A global leader with these nonsense"
4,"Pros: 1. Good battery backup 2. UI is very good 3. Samsung knox security 4. Display is ok Cons: 1. Camera performance is just above par in suficient light, but too much noise in low light shots 2. Little bit of delay in app opening 3. Be clear, it is *NOT FOR GAMING*  Overall one of the best for normal users under 10k"
5,Value for money üí∞ it's camera is best battery life is awesome

4,This product is acctullly best. best coloty and design. But sound is little low not bed its a perfect but little low. bass is very powerful and clear. battery backup is very best in this price range. definately you purchase this product.
4,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.
3,"Boat is getting better in sound over time and this one is my 4th product, still it suffering to produce clarity. But it is disappointing to see the cheap materials and lousy designs are been accepted. Material quality is no at all near to good, thats means it won't last long. Battery backup is really good, been 27 hours and still running, though battery housing is not sealed properly to provide IPX7 capability, Image attached. Now, the bass is better then others in this range but bellow 70 H..."
4,"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil..."

So, I used both but one plus Neckband is looking like cheapest Neckband but Now I am using boat & it's look like an expensive Neckband. So I am highly satisfied with this Neckband.

5,"Writing this review after using more than 15 days. 255F pro+ has super sound quality. Bass is decent and fair enough. Most important highlight of this headset is battery life,it's amazing. Runtime depends on usage but definitely it will give you more than any other headset. Should go for it."
5,"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good. The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good. The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.  My opinion:- Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme..."

It's in warenty so I will update this review after I get touch with boat's customer service .
5,Good Product long lasting battery But when i compare it with my Infinity glide 120 the sound and bass are better there alas the its battery is only 6hrs so if you need good voice with better build quality with less battery go with glide 120 but if you.need A little less audio not much just a little and way long lasting battery go with this one
4,"Reviewing after using for 1 month.  Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies.  Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume.  Noise isolation: Decent.  Fit: Excellent.  Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it.

Quality of voice over MIC is very good 6. Battery backup is really amazing  Excellent product. ! No other brands can challenge the boat. It's the beat bluetooth go for it without any doubt
5,"Incredible  I've been using TWS earphones but now I have upgrades to this is worth it  Pros: super comfy, one can easily spend hours using this  Due to the ear wing the buds become more fit and secure  Trebbles are awesome, highs n lows are very well Balanced.*and the bass is fabulous* also no distortion And sound is clear till 100% vol.  It also has dual pairing mode  The biggest pro is that it has 40 hour of video playback and IPX7 water n sweat resistance  when I compared it with boat..."
5,Best product below 2k. Sound quality is amazing. Its like a home theatre inside my ears. Battery is excellent. No issue with the buttons. Range is also good. But the ear buds are not comfortable becoz my earholes are too small even the small bud is not working for me. Other than that its a good one. I will update after 1 month.
5,As compared to any other company models and even boat most famous model this is the best product. With a dedicated mic and enormous battery backup. I don't suppose any other blutooth headset can compete with this. I have tried and tested with my office calls and response was amazing. Due to to Covid situation Work from home this product is the best support. It connects with my Laptop and mobile at the same time. And I can easily switch between concalls and online calls work great throughout ...
5,Thank you flipkart for best deal I got this for 1299 and earphone is amazing .. sound quality is great and charging is also great.. if anyone is searching earphone for wireless earphone with budget 1500 you can go for this .. trust me it's a best deal .
5,Nice base and sound quality enjoyable ‚ò∫Ô∏è I prefer it's good battery back up is so nice üòâ nice product from boat and filpcart üí™üëç
5,"Have never used BoAt accessories before, bought this bluetooth and a Type C data cable, both working like a charm. Happy that I bought this headphone, battery üîã backup is really amazing and sound the quality is too good."
4,After using for more than 10 days I am writing this review... 1. Sound is okay nothing great 2. Noise cancellation is not good atall the other person can hear lots of disturbance in call 3. Battery is long lasting I used for total 12 days after one complete charge and I use it daily for atleast 5-6 hours for official calls. Secondly it takes less then an hour for 100% charge... 4. Boat has to work more on sound quality on bluetooth devices as their wired headphones has par quality then this....
4,Base is not good but volume is so loud üôÇ Treble are good also Battery life is ultimate awesome üòç Overall Best neckband
4,Every thing is just awesome but build quality of boat products as usual sucks... If handled carefully can last about 1 yr or more but not then it can't survive Only go for it if u r not a rough user By seeing its quality i can say its more durable than its 225 nd 255 pro version but not as durable as realme dizo neckands. So if a heavy user i suggest go for realme Or if u get this at below 1200(in sale/offer ) Then only go for it Other than that i am extremely happy with its mic and s...
3,It was a worthy purchase at the price tag of 1200. Good sound and bass.. Mic is very average as it's not noise cancelling.. The build quality is very poor and have zero premium feel...it feels like I bought a road side brand.. battery backup us awesome.. Over all a decent budget earphone..
5,Nycc product reasonable rate All are well and good Battery backup is also good Nice in colour All is well about this
1,"Its only 7 months I bought this product. It was convenient for me to use. Sound,Bass everything is good but. It said it has water & sweat resistance power. I never worked out wearing these not splashed any water but still one side stopped working in 1 second without any warning. I feel like I wasted my money in this. Wired earphones work longer than this."
5,"Its a best option for 1500 budget value people, its best headphones ever i purchase, it's bass is like ""ooo maa gu turu lob"".such a amazing headphones"
5,"Just got the package ‚ò∫Ô∏è And Unboxed it and just Sayed wow the packaging style of boat is superb and the sound is also very good , Bass is also very Good and design is also killing üî• But the main problem is in fittings but it doesn't matter I just want a monster battery life I got my package on 11 Oct.

5,It's amazing bluetooth..I have use five days..5th day I will started use 100% battery then five days after checking now 80% balance.. battery backup.. value of money 100%... sound is soooooo coool n clear..base sound.. thank you flipcort love you
5,This is the best Bluetooth earphone for all Battery backup excellent and support fast charging Sound and bass is superb
5,Battery backup is very good. Fitting in ear is not so good. Base is good. Right side wire is heavy Bcoz of that right ear is not comfortable for long duration. Battery backup is 3 days continue uses.
4,"I have oneplus base edition too and that's darn better than it in sound clarity and design, it's design is not for those who wear it while sleeping and also not comfortable to wear for a long but oneplus one is really a better option than this because of its body softness and in ear experience,yeah sound quality too."
5,"The best so far. Battery beast and bass will be better than many similar products ( use suitable bud)  Friends and relatives who tried once got addicted instantly and asked me to order. Out of stock everywhere. Once it comes to stock, just but without any hesitations. Useful for workouts too. Design and style are awesome. Build quality is lesser when compared to other boat models"
4,It‚Äôs amazing product and worth for money. It‚Äôs sound quality is good and comfort in use. I would prefer to buy this product.
5,Superb blutooth. Best part is their sound quality. And it has huge battery backup which makes it more worth it.
5,Excellent product earlier i was too confuse should i buy or not but finally I had made a decision to buy because currently I'm using boat 402 which is excellent in term of everything but mine friend like neck band that's why i had order this one for him. friend if you like neck bands then go for this or if you like wireless then you should prefer boat 402 hope this will help you to choose correct products
5,Such a nice product please buy it . This sound is awesome.this model also very nice and this battery backup 40 hours very nice product . Thank you Flipkart
5,"Lot of confusions before buying, whether to buy neckband or airdopes. At last i settled with Boat neckband. Already using Boat headphones & speakers so i believed in sound quality & clarity. Really best neckband at this price point. Sound is soo clear, enjoying music with clear & quality bass. Battery backup is soo good, came 100% charged and still 97% Overall its a good quality product. Go for it guys."
5,"This one has been value for money. Was skeptical to buy or with no reviews, but worth it.  PROs 1. The bass and effects are too good. Typical boAt. 2. The battery backup too sustains for 8+ hours continuous usage. 3. Microphone pickup is very good. Noise cancellation does not work that well. But very good for calls and meetings. 4. Length of cable to ear is long enough to keep microphone and controls easily accessible. 5. Very Light Weight.  CONs 1. The build quality is something that I di..."

5,"Was using Bullets z, 255F pro sounds is louder than bullets and provides thumping base. The only complain I have is the design and build quality. The band doesn't wrap around neck since the plastic is a bit hard, therefore not very good for people who wants to use it especially for running or jogging, although for those who wants to use it while wearing helmet for driving, it's a good choice.  30 hours minimum backup no matter how and at what volume you use it.  In short it's a good deal for ..."

3,Sound and Bass Quality is good as expected from Boat! Battery Backup is also upto the mark; it's almost a week with moderate use and the battery level is still 50% But the look and the quality of material is objectionable as it doesn't look premium and the colour is also very much different from the one which is shown in display. But overall performance is good.

And it is really unexpected from boat.. Go for other earphones"
3,"Ok so I'm writing this review after using it for almost a month  1.Battery backup- you will never regret spending on it.

Previously was using OnePlus bullets wireless Z but after purchasing this , I can clearly say that boat headset stands nowhere infront of OnePlus headsets. Really very disappointed with the headset. Was not expecting this kind of service from Boat. Can't give 0 stars so giving one star or else it's not even giving one star."
1,"The Product is over-hyped in terms of sound and quality. Yes, it is economical in terms of Price and features it is providing. My Experience is, it is creating distorting sound when plugged inside ears. Also in a couple of minutes the ear plugs make ear pain which is unacceptable from comfort perspective. Overall, not a great experience using these earphones"

Previously was using OnePlus bullets wireless Z but after purchasing this , I can clearly say that boat headset stands nowhere infront of OnePlus headsets. Really very disappointed with the headset. Was not expecting this kind of service from Boat. Can't give 0 stars so giving one star or else it's not even giving one star."

Previously was using OnePlus bullets wireless Z but after purchasing this , I can clearly say that boat headset stands nowhere infront of OnePlus headsets. Really very disappointed with the headset. Was not expecting this kind of service from Boat. Can't give 0 stars so giving one star or else it's not even giving one star."

My Experience is, it is creating distorting sound when plugged inside ears. Also in a couple of minutes the ear plugs make ear pain which is unacceptable from comfort perspective.

5,"I've been using this product for the last 3 days. This might be too early to write an elaborate review but I've known enough about this neckband to be ""eligible"".  1. Sound Quality: The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me. Whether it's about mid frequencies, vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even the lower frequencies, this neckband deals all of those with superior performance. Undoubtedly.  2. Bass: Bass is..."
5,Awesome product..... With a super deep bass and excellent charging capacity... I loved it‚ô•‚ô•
5,Very nice product with amazing battery back up and deep bass.. Awsome sound clarity.it is very flexible Length of wire is little low.
5,"Amazing product... Super quick connectivity, so far i didn't have any connection drop... The band is super soft and you can keep it in your pocket very easly... Sound quality is amazing And yesss bass is also great for norml humans.. I listen music at 70% volume and even than bass is ama, ing vocals are clear And at 100% you can even sit in auto and can listen to your favourite music... Go for it without second thought"
5,"Excellent quality.. Packing is awesome.. Neckband quality is impressive its very Soft rubber, light weight.. Sound quality is very nice.. And bass is impressive.. Backup is approx 14 to 15 hours easily in medium volume.. Very fast Bluetooth connectivity and switching.. Type c charging cable.. I think it is best in this Price range."
5,"Some ones are still telling there is no Bass. Actually this wireless headset bass is awesome. Getting a well balanced sound with bass boosted ‚ô•Ô∏è  Battery backup is beast. Nothing to sayüî•  About microphone, this is good but no noise cancellation. Catches all the sound.üòí  Design wise it's ultra beast. More flexible.üôÇ  One thing is don't lost the tag in the neckband. Keep it safely for warranty claim‚úÖ  *writing this thing using 3 days. i will keep updating about my using experience"
5,This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.
5,"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.  This is after 10days review. I charged for 3time only- battery backup really nice No irritation at all while placing There is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving person Sounds are really amazing  I will re edit again after 20days Design, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use. No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.  Nice one... Good ..."
2,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios. I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up. But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
1,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
1,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me ü§¨
5,NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well. The connectivity is pretty impressive..The fit is perfect in ears and doesn't give pain after long hours.I was using MI Basic earphones for a year and switched into this and I think it was the best decision ever.Overall it is the perfect earpiece that u can have for enjoying uninterrupted songs and voice calls.
4,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ..."
5,Before purchasing I was so nervous about it. But now i bet no else wireless earphone can compete it.... Realme is nothing in front of it.... The things i loved:  *Bass is more than expected... outsatanding Bass..üòç primium sound...u can't tolerate bass at 100% voluneüòéüî• awesome bass  * It's 60% volume is far better than other earphones 100% volume  *packing was really awesome üòç...felt proud in opening itüôà‚ù£Ô∏è  *You can fold it and make ut so small and keep it in the pocket.ü§©  * If still yo...
5,"I just love this earphone. The sound quality is just awesome. The audio is pretty loud and decent, not harsh. The mic quality is also brilliant. It has Bluetooth 5.0. The connectivity is very easy. I can easily connect it with multiple devices. I like the music backup it almost lasts for 15 hr. Which is enough for my daily usage. I highly like this."
5,"I recommended to all the buyer to go for this product only there are lots of brand in the market like noise, jbl, Realme boat and all but if your budget is 2000 then go for this item only you gona love it trust me. this is the long term review from my side and thanx me later."
1,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones, Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"

5,After use of 1 week i am writing this review and after searching for 6 months almost I bought this hands-free. My first priority was good battery backup which completely ful fill with this product. And also nice sound quality. Product delivered before time so thank for that.
4,Some time audio can be disconnected...     Change Audio tract is not working properly...     I am so excited with battery life it's was really awesome...     Audio and bass quality is not good but it ok...     Worthy for this budget...     If you need extra bass and extra audio don't choose it with my personal suggestion
5,What a product i ve ever used.i get it on very low price thank u flipkart for the wonderful offer.i have purchase 2 quantity one for my brother also.he is happy with this product.
4,Fast connecting user friendly good battery life studio quality surround quality stereo quality minute sound qualities always very good bass quality average bass uses I am not recommend.

5,The quality of the headphone is awesome. Easy to connect to any mobile and PC. Sound quality and bass are satisfactory and worth every penny. Go for it!
1,"Writing this review after 2 months. Very bad quality, lose one side. One side is not working after 2 months.  If you like listening music you will be very disappointed. Even an earphone that comes free with phone are better than this. It's a base edition without base. I don't know if the people who have given it 5 star are deaf or what. Previously I had Jabra elite 25e and these earphones are not working even 10% of that. At full volume it has no music but distortion. The fit in the ear is re..."

5,Simply outstanding Review after 5days of heavy usage First thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too. The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best. The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too.. Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.
4,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 .."
5,"I've been using this product since last 6 months and i am excited to tell you that this product is worth the price. Its completely water resistant because once i was riding my bike through the city i had this headset worn my neck and it started raining and i was all set including the headset,i thought everything was over since water was everywhere and surpricingly everything works excellent when i connected again after reaching home. Working till now with no issues. Highly Recommended...."
4,Bought these headphones 3 weeks back Pros: 1. excellent build quality 2. Great bass and sound 3. light weight and handy 4. gives me 10hrs of battery back up 5. really good quick charge  Cons: 1. Missing quick switch button
5,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.
5,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.
5,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.
4,Buy without any second thought just bought it and the sound quality is pretty darn good the bass is also good but not as punchy as realmebuds wireless but the bass is present and it's awesome the balanced sound quality is op
4,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.
3,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat. Guys one most important thing I wish to add here, please don't trust on YouTube vi..."
4,PROS * Sound quality *Good bass better than previous bullets *Battery backup is good *Comfortable neckband *You can listen each and every instrument sound clearly *Call quality is good *Noise cancellation is not better we can expect it *Stylish and simple CONS *Noise cancellation is not good *Eartips are made in plastic so we can listen low bass *call quality is good and some noise we can observe *Latency is ok not good at all *High sound makes some noise and we can miss crystal clear sound
5,"I have been using it for over 3 months now. My priority is to take calls. Usage - 80% Official calls, 20% regular stuff. I am writing this review after using different brands TWS. I have segregated my points: 1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice. The caller on the other side doesnt even come to know that we are using bluetooth device instead of wired headphones. 2. Sound quality is v..."
4,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side. And low latency mode best in this price range...even with a non-Oneplus device( I've a Samsung phone ). Overall valu..."

4,I have been using then for more than 13 days now and I think it's a good time to tell what i think about them. VOCALS AND SOUND QUALITY are simply superb you can here even the smallest sounds very clearly and BASS is good but it's not very much high. Build Quality is very good you can use it for hours and won't even feel them they are light and material quality is good. CONNECTIVITY is also very good. BATTERY BACKUP is EXCELLENT you can use them for 2 days on a single charge and charges very ...
3,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.
3,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.

Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.
4,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245. Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good ."

3,"Last version of one plus eaephones was more technologically advanced, this one has got all the good features except for the swap switch where just by pressing the button i could pair with different devices. Not so happy with it, also the battery back up is less compared to previous version of this. However its not that great nor is it too bad. Nothing so cool, its similar to realme or mi earphones."

3,Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying
5,Awesome experience after 1 week Battery backup super Awesome Very nice product
5,Sound quality is decent bass is below average you don't expect bass like headphone. Best part about your earphone fast charging and battery backup just 15 minute charge and you're good to go for 10 to 12 hours
3,"Good connectivity, battery backup and build quality. Sound quality is so average, definitely not as good as my boat rockers 255. Useful for office work, attending calls or listening to lectures. A big no for listening to music."
4,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.
3,"hello, If you're 1+ Bullets wireless Z Bass user mean... You can hear opponents voice very well even if you ride bike. But Opponents didn't hear your voice when u ride bike and in travelling. Otherwise it's one of the best in this price.. Bass is powerful and Good."
5,Evry thing is all right but belive me guys it cant overtake boat headphones or realme wireless bud 2..... I have these all..... Here they named bass edition . But if u use boat and realme you never use this one.....but sound detail is very good.....you can listen evey minute instruments sounds.....   And the very importet point of this headphone is. The best bluetooth neck band for pubg....no one can beat this one in case of pubg .....so if u are a pubg lover and no headphone jack dont worry ...
5,"Actually this is the earphones that once I dreamt of. Now I got this and I am really really was excited about this.The sound quality is so far the best in the segment and the reengineered bass is so sick.The battery pack up has no issues cause it supports warp charging, so 10 minutes is crazy fast. And the built quality has been always better with one plus.So I am fully satisfied"
5,Best and most lovable one. The true one plus brand. Go for it without doubt. I assure this

And as always thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of the product. Flipkart as always is my favorite online store and provides with best service every time.
5,I liked everything about this bluetooth.  call quality - Superb (everywhere) sound quality - very good battery backup - very good ( easily 2 days for normal users and for heavy users easily 1 day with 20% power left) Connectivity - Super fast (just seperate ear buds and done if ur blutooth is on and u connected it earlier) charging time - 10 min for 80% as far as i remember and its real 3 ear tips provided and one type C charging cable with this. mterial quality used is very good and flexible...
4,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.
3,Dont look only brand value. Good but not worthy for 1999. Go for any other like boat or something else.
4,Fantastic system it has but not have bass. Sound quality is average. I would like to inform you that do not waste your money by seeing ONEPLUS tag. You can buy better Wireless Earphone at very cheap price of Boat. Sound quality good but no to appreciate!
5,Product is great. Gets charge quickly and last for long. Sound and built quality is best within this price range. Not recommended for gamers though as letency is high. Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.
5,Easy to carry. Best sound quality. Strong sensor. Water proof In one word just wow
4,"I am writting this review after 3 weeks of usage.  Sound- First thing first if you like to hear just bass and don't care about anything else then don't buy this one, go for Boat or Realme, but if you are like me who likes well balance sound with decent base then i think this is the best headset for this price, bass is not overpowering nether its dull its just comes alive when you need it.  Battery- Most people will be impressed by its fast changing, i charge it for 10 minutes and it gives me..."
3,"After one month review:- the speakers are creating distorting sound. A series of cricket sound is coming. Initial impression:- There is a hype for one plus product. That's why we pay extra attention to it and it gets its work done. The wire is thin and thus not sure how long it may last. The neck band is soft thus not felt some thing on neck. That's really comfortable. But only comfort can't compensate the risk of getting teared the ear plugin wire, as it's 2k. A general person can't afford ..."
5,"This is very good headphone AFAIK. It takes only 10mins to charge 80% (any charger which supports quick charge can be used, i used my poco 18W charger) which is sufficient for 10hrs usage. It takes 1hr to reach 100% charge. Battery life is fantastic i got around 15 to 16hrs. Volume is too high so can't go over 50%. Build quality looks nice, feels sturdy and the cable is braided. The fit is comfortable and Weightless. Sound quality is above average. Yeah bass is present. Call quality is excell..."
5,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point."
3,Good bluetooth earphones but price was high for middle class music lovers .bass was good for listinining.mic was not clear in running or at bike.battery back up was nice.earphone 100% not fit into ur ears exactly . totally my opinion sound quality and battery backup good .price comparison was too High .
5,"Now from my experience, I searched for a lot of earphones and saw each and every one... What I found was this bass edition is better than most other wireless earphones though some reviews said that build quality is not good.. what I feel is.. sound quality, bass ... Very good! Very happy about it.. Connectivity is top notch... Easy to wear... No any ear pain during long hours of usage.. But battery back up... Its been 5 days now..

Best earphone under 2-4k.

1,Do not buy Calling with my bullets z bass edition connected via bluetooth cause a buzzing noise which can be heard by the other person. This goes away if I switch to phone or speaker mode so its obviously an earphone or bluetooth issue. Also I cannot hear the noise but the person on the other end of the call hears it. This dosen't happen while listening to music. Resetting the earphones sometimes works for sometime but then the issue occurs randomly again.

5,Disegine best battery backup is good 12-14hour backup
5,"I had bullet wireless z first edition, now switched to z bass edition. One notable difference is, while on call during bike ride with old z ppl complained about wind blowing sound and it really affected the quality but now the person on the other end is not complaining the same. I thought the replacement of mic from the wire will affect the quality of the call but surprisingly it only increased the quality. And about bass i can feel a notable amount of difference. Now the bass is more awesome..."

2,Not working properly
4,Nice sound value for money must buy product
1,Quality is very poor.. very much disappointed

5,Mind-blowing product (full comfortable with body & sound )
5,I love product OnePlus earphone very nice
3,Very good
5,Very comfortable.Design is good but I was a bit unsatisfied with the position of the control part but after some use I became used to that. Bass is more than that of it's previous version but not like in a wired headset. 8hr continuous working after full charge and taking 40min to full charge after complete discharge.
5,Bass is really awesome n heavy which obviously it's point of selling....this can handle higher bass songs without any tearing up of sound.... battery would have been much better....they claim 17 hrs battery backup but practically it lasts 12-13 hrs .....would recommend everyone to burn these for 2-3 hrs before putting it on...... rating 4/5.
5,"Value for money.... Decent sound and bass of the product Overall satisfied with my purchase ""Value for money product """

5,"Great product, amazing sound quality. Battery backup is best in class. Can go for this without second thoughts."
5,Awesome
3,Although it's a good gadget as far as earphones goes the one major flaw is we can't change songs using volume buttons...... Which is basically the biggest boon of using any bluetooth earphones.... So when we are doing something and wanna change the track we have no choice but to do it using our phone ......which in my opinion sucks..... When you have to do it using the phone anyway what's the upside of having a bluetooth earphone ....even a cheap quality 50 rupees wired earphone have the same...

1,I really don't understand why this magnetic power on and off is inbuilt when maximum backup is only one day. Its useless feature as of mine. There is a connectivity issue becoz of this magnetic power on off. Battery backup is very poor when compared to other bluetooth headphones. Earpods also not comfortable. Voice is echoing when hearing because of closed earpods
1,Very bad
5,I love you

1,Items is taking about two hours for complete charging and it's getting consumed within 5 hrs.  10 min= 10 hrs concept is totally failed. OnePlus company is only doing marketting by this concept. Totally disappointed from this OnePlus wireless earphone.
2,"Sounds low, never expected such thing from a brand."
1,Sond koliti bad
2,Experience is not good with this earphones
1,"Not working for calls, getting extra noise in calls, very costly with no basic quality"

4,in the range of 2k you must give 1st preference of this product .
5,Best products
4,Over all product is nice.But noise cancellation is worst.For online classes and for music purpose this earphone is very nice and while listening music we can hear every instrument sound very clearly. So if and one want to buy it you can buy it. But for calling purpose it is waste. Better you can buy oppo Enco M31 will be the best option for all purpose.But only 8 hrs play back time. You can ask your doubts in instagram

I usually charge it for just 5 minutes and 1 days full use is enough.  Music üéµ is also power-packed. With this price range i quite shocked first that one plus can give this type of sound. Usually i found this type of sound and clearity in higher range with premium brands like Audio technica, AKG, Marshalls and B&O's ..."

5,"1st of all the same day delivery by the ekart is really appreciated.Talking about the device,it's a blind go for bass lovers.call quality is also good,can give 4/5 for call quality.You will get a noticeable sound latency during playing games.Overall a true value for money device I recommend to go for it under 2k."
4,Decent product. I couldn't feel the bass even in the bass boosted version. LOL
5,Not happy with the product..you can't pick the call directly from the earphone..

5,Good sound
5,Nice product
4,All is well. But it's not good design. The earphone automatically sticks out of the ear.
4,"Sound is too high if heard in full sound, It would leave you with an unnecessary headache but overally if u hear it with the recomended sound,like u can rise up to the volume until your phone says ""More can cause damage"". And the call quality is not out of the box. The voice over the call gets a bit like disconnected.  Overally the product is good but it is not a 100% I would give it a 85 our of 100.  ..."
5,Guys you can blindly trust to oneplus for this product. Seriously it's a superb superb bluetooth sound system. I'm fully satisfied
3,"Active noise cancellation is not up to the mark. Sound quality is good. Battery backup is also good, runs for 2 days with a good usage. Also facing lot of connectivity issues with my redmi note 7 during calling, sometimes voice does not come"

5,Headphones is just osm. If u have to feel deep bass is there for u. low latency is work on utube but while I am typing on keyboard latency is more. Vocal and mids is ok but not superb but if u have listen it on high quality audio it is superb. Battery backup is osm reason to buy it is battery backup and deep bass.honest review!! Go for it ....

5,Nice smartwatch...  Pros: nice look Metal build Simple UI Nice & colourful Display 5 - 7 days battery Dizo application is good 5 atm water resistance  Cons: watch goes to little heavy side Screen protection not specified Few bugs in UI and Dizo app Not suitable for Small wrests No screen protector with watch

4,Watch is good looking. But the Dizo iOS app should be more attractive and more user handy and need to be improved a lot.
5,best watch available for this price and features are awesome with the display weight no defective product and great features and 15 sports mode the sensors are high quality with find my phone option and 4 heart modes new displays and very good battery life love the product and cannot find any other watch like this these are better then mi band and other smart watches you get the price very low mentioned and don't judge it by the price you will love the product and battery charging is awesome...
5,"Best option under 2000.Spo2 and heart rate working good and watch is really fast in sync as soon as you get notification in your phone without any lag watch also receive msg (same time notification). *Good looks *100 + watch face * Real spo2 and HR sensor(24 hr HR Monitoring,high and low heart rate reminder you can set it through realme link app) * Fast synchronization with your phone * Value for money"
5,"This is the thing which you need , best watch ever ,the quality is good 'can't say bad ' it has metal body so no problem , battery is enough 7-8 days. 5 ATM , features are awesome but I will say Dizo to make it's sensors more accurate it is good but it can be made more accurate so by an update you can make it more accurate even it counts steps when I go to college on scooty you should work on it . Overall it is good , thankyou."
5,"It is the best smartwatch. Some of its pros are: #It worth its cost. #I like the wallpapers. #Metallic built give it a premium look. #Straps are very soft. There are a few cons: #Pixel density is less, that's why some wallpapers does not look good. #Raise to wake is little slow but that's ok. #It is a little heavy also. Overall it is the best smartwatch under this price range."
5,Awesome watch by dizo(realme) everything is perfect according to price point even a metallic body under 3k is absolutely unexpected anyways very impressed with the watch good really good smartwatch. Moreover The 1.69 Inch large display makes it a perfect wareable watch you can set analogue digital style in your watch with 70+ watch faces in dizo app
5,"Dizo watch is a good one lauch by realme. It's battery working fine for 10 days,also display make it glorious. It's perfect in look too. Go for it"
5,"I Like the Design of Dizooooo it's Super, Build Quality Great Display Nice and Tracking also Good over all Value for Money üòò"
3,"Well, The watch is good, Has a lot of watch faces when connected with the Dizo app. Good enough battery life and charging time. But, few things I couldn't skip saying - It only connects with DIZO App. Watches like Dizo Watch Pro, Dizo Watch, Realme Watch S/S Pro Realme Watch Pro/ 2 Pro connects with Realme Link Application and can sync data with Google Fit. But somehow they didnt add Dizo Watch 2 into Realme Link and the QR Fails to recognise device in Realme Link. I can only connect it to DI..."

5,Nice product satisfied for any customer screen is big and attractive
5,In this price it a very nice product. I checked in water also. Most of it is a very value for money product. The response of this product is a little bit slow but it can be ignore. The SpO2 measure system also not bad some times 1 or 2% errors are there. The Dizo App helps to connect with the device. But it takes all the permissions for run it. So before connecting with the mobile check the terms and conditions.

2,Display gets scratches easily ....then it looks bad .. Please consider it while buying
2,Nothing to say about this watch. Simply mind blowing. All the colours are beautiful. Just need improvements in the app as lag issue is there and few bugs too.  After 10 days. Colour Fade issue within 10 days.

4,Awesome üî•
5,Nice product
5,The build quality of the watch is unmatched in this price range. The metal build of zinc alloy looks very premium and the UI is also very responsive. The features on this watch are also good for the price. The watch is slightly on the heavier side due to the metal build in comparison to other plastic body smartwatches but I'd pick that any day over a plastic build.
4,Good watch Go for it
5,Great watch
4,Wow
2,"Its an average product , i didn't suggest anyone to buy Mi band 5 have better display quality, faces, features, accuracy"

5,"Built quality is top notch..very premium looking watch at this amazing price point. However activity tracking takes a toll. Sleep monitoring is not at all accurate. Step counting also misses few steps or adds some. Display being an IPS panel gives decent colours, a bit on shallower side. But the brightness level compensates it all. Overall a awesome looking watch with decent features. You won't regret after having it!"

Since i get too occupied with my work, i love it when it reminds me to take an activity, or be it checking the pulse rate, o2 level or steps taken. Its best in the market."
5,"I was really stunned by getting such a best product I was never knowing that Flipkart would provide me with such prestantious gagdtes or electronics ,,,,, the watch is just topgallant and perfect ,,, the belt,, it's display ,,it's screen it's features the charging everything is next to perfect ... I would recommend everyone to buy this watch it's the best budget watch with several features which any normal persons or even gym and fitness persons wants ...."
5,"Best smartwatch you can get at this price range. A whopping good battery backup, charges up pretty fast too... UI is pretty good"
2,Notifications are biggest issue. You have to do the setting again and again in the app. Even after that notification functionality doesn't work properly. No wonder why it's so cheap. Won't recommended to buy it. As there is no use of the smart watch if you don't get proper notifications.

5,"After 2 days of research, 100 of reviews and YouTube videos I finally got this with Republic Day offer for 2k. Mostly it is 2.5k. its worth the money. Compared to nearest competition (noise, Miband, realme) it is not only cheaper but has more features like water resistance (I have literally washed it with soap!). Oxygen sensor is accurate (checked with actual oxymeter), walking tracker is bang accurate. For price of an Apple watch you can buy Boat watch for your entire apartment."
2,"Giving 2 star because ITs Made in China and theres REBOOT bug during synchronization, I hope they fix it in upcoming updates. - Watch is good for the price - Heart rate sensor is quite close to my oximeters heart rate sensor but I would NOT recommend using this for medical purpose - Watch looks good, rubber strap seems good quality - Didn't like cloud watch faces and just began using default watch face. - Custom wallpapers can be applied but then you'll have to live with small font time. I do..."
3,"Don't expect surprises, it's best for the price only. Screen size is too small, strap quality is average, UI is not so smooth, battery capacity need to check on the go. What I didn't like most will be the screen - both quality as well as size. I bought this cos ot has BP, spo2 and heart rate monitors."

3,Hi all...this is my first review in flipkart and basically I don't what to do the same..but now I am disclosing my views is that how really the watch works.  Cons:  The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version. 1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app 2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...
5,"Awesome I suggest every one to buy this bez try new good battery life, good performance, looks classy"
5,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch  At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price It was a very very low weight watch. The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.  Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,  At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it. Thank You  Like the review if you get helped out."
5,"Most affordable smart watch with all required built in features like oxygen saturation, blood pressure monitor etc. Worth buying..."
5,Beautiful smart watch loved its look just awesome at this price....
4,"After lot of research, finally decided to go with Boat Smart watch. Got the delivery in 2 days. FlipKart is as usual rocking with speed delivery. I haven't fully checked all the options of the watch but as a first look, watch is good. Light weight. Syncs well eith mobile phone via ProGear App. Able to change the skin via cloud. So far so good. Will check other features and update my review later."
1,We used this smart watch in 3 month then we write the review Battery capacity only 10 days approx Touch display good Sensor not work Screen is good  Not good product.
5,This watch looks really cool. I loved it. Thanks for fast delivery. Excellent choice for those who are looking for a fitness band.
1,Watch wise good but smart watch wise fail i bought for check oxizen level but it fail.
5,"Its very osm, light weight value for money, notification and activity tracker is fantastic connectivity is good, accuracy is good smooth and easy function."
4,"If call function is it there this watch is awesome , and even we can't attend call but we can see notification and reject the call , very simplest design and limited app facilities. Heart beat measurements are accurate or not I'm not sure about is steps and other calorie function are normal like other smart watch and battery capacity is depends on usage specified by the product üôÇ"
5,"I got it for 2K, in this budget this is the best watch. I am writing this review after 7 day of use. Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed. Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc. In 2000 this is the best watch. It looks very premium. Battery can last upto 4-5 days."
4,This watch is made in PRC that is made in China. If i would have known this before buying would have never bought this. Regret now.  About product : Nice product for 2000 bucks. Health reading are not so accurate but near to accurate. I am buying smart watch first time so happy with it.Battery backup is excellent. Touch is fine as well.
5,It's a very nice watch. Really value for money. I liked it alot. Design and buit quality both are awsome. It also comes with good features in this price segment. And it looks so classy.
5,I purchased this watch and I am very happy with this watch who all are finding the budget watch please buy this one if you have only 2000 ruppees budget so at my point of view and experience with this watch please extend your budget little bit more to 2500 ruppees but must buy this watch and it's app is also very easy to use and who all are saying that the app is so bad no it's not all those who are saying this they don't know about technology and watch looks also very impressive but company...

Cons - vibration quality not upto the mark as i felt as compared to mi band (i used). , heart rate measurement fluctuating always & the fluctuation digits reading for 2-3 times is not nearby accurate reading. And the main issue i checked, it looses the connection from the app boat progear automatically anytime , you have to checkin into the..."
5,Very nice watch.. Very nicely working. Charging is fast and battery life is more than a week.  Dial little small but fits to my wrist. Very amazing product.
5,"I think I have got this in a best deal of 1,999/- over all product is really good watch looks classy, custom wallpaper is one of the best thing which attracted me.. Over all nice product Good design n perfect finish of display 5* to STORM ."
5,Best watch in this range and all features are working well just go for it battery backup is very strong you can easily use watch for 5-6 days in full battery
5,1. Light weight 2. Easy to use all the options 3. Wellness mode is awesome and lookalike accurate so far. 4. Connectivity with Boat pro gear all is easy and hassle free. 5.Ordered yesterday 12PM and Delivered at 12PM and 5 star delivery from Ekart.
5,Fabulous watch under 2500. I have gifted to my hubby on our anniversary. Thank you boat and Flipkart for speedy delivery
3,All is very good but Bluetooth is not perfect work on within 5 meter Renge ...is not good company given 10 meter... So not happy but ok
5,"First of all if you have any dout so kick it out best smart watch under this prove range you are not going to find a smart watch under 4000-5000 with all those features it offers under 2500. Good Features- It offers heartrate, o2 which are very accurate. The bp featurr is very satisfactory. The sports modes are awesome. Its user interface is very clean i dont know why people just say that it is bad. Its design is just awesome and looks premium.  Cons- Its app has some bugs to be fixed aft..."
3,I am I'm not able to to add my custom picture in the watch as a wallpaper so I I find it many ways to do it but in the end I could not find any solution to add my custom picture in the the watch itself so if you have any solution to it kindly inform me otherwise the watch is ok a the display is shorter than I thought in the pic the straps are good otherwise all the features are good except the display and I am not able to change the picture
5,"Awesome product, feature laden smartwatch, does not betray at any point. I am submitting this after one week use of product. It has motion sensors which can monitor my SPO2, heart rate and Blood Pressure to stay healthy and fit, this is a combination of all. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this. I am giving a 5 star to a very nice product. All functions are working properly and efficiently. I have paid Rs.2999/- for this product where Battery back up during the week is very good re..."
3,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better"
4,"Watch Is Very Good And The Best In This Price Range - 2500 Rs .. But The App is Very Bad And Updates Are Worst .. There Are Some Problems With Watch Faces , Whatsapp Notifications .. Except This The Watch Is Worth For Buying ... If You Are Looking For The Best Watch Under 3500 Rs Or 3000rs Definitely Buy This Watch .. And Another Alternate is Zebronics Smart Watch Which Costs Around 2300 Rs"
3,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow. But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price."
4,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.  If you are in the market for an entry level fitness tracker, this will do just good!!"
4,"Nice product. I got it for 2000 rs only .battery is good and charging also..display is average..not good..the display is far far better on amazefit bip u..if u a crisp and hd display lover ,add some money and go for amazefit bip u..you will love it.Apart from display everything else is really good"
3,The features are not that much godd if you compare with amaze fit or noise pro 3 but at this price segment it is perfect i bought it at 1999 rs in sale and i personally think it is the cheapest smart watch with the features like spo2. So it is value for money.
5,This review is after one week of useage. Value for money. Seems very accurate on all features like step counting & sports. 13% change remaining on 6th day after first charging. I like this product.
4,Its good one .. nice features for this rate.. i took this under bigbillon day.. and receive best one.
5,Boat strom smartwatch is real good deal under 2000 and it's completely value for money...  But the only thing is it calculates steps even when we are on train bus or car..... I had 40000 steps in one day when I was in train and hadn't walk more the 500 steps because I was in train for whole day  Oximeter will always shows 99% Blood pressure will. Show completely wrong reading  Heart rate is accurate  Overall you can go for it....heart rate reading is quite accurate Avoid buying it only if you...
5,"Good watch during sports activities. Nice design.. Display of step counting is very small for older people. Bp, oxigen count and heart beat are almost accurate... Any way good item.. Battery will last for 6 days"
4,"I received watch on 28 April. Watch came with charger, warranty card,boat sticker. It was well packed,in good condition. Look wise it's looks good. Display is good n clear even under sunlight. Belt won't very very best quality but it's very decent n acceptable one light weight we can change if needed. Watch tracks steps with difference of +- 10 steps when crosschecked manually counting n with my old lenovo hw01 band. Spo2 it reads with very well being a surgeon I checked with our standard O2..."
5,"Nice and good product by boat Pros 1. Simple design 2. Matel body 3. Simple UI 4. HR, spo2, BP sensor  Cons 1. Watch faces are not available 2. Stress monitor not available although BP sensor available"
5,"Screen resolution: good Wake up on rise: takes 1 second to wake Watch faces: only 3 watch faces available (You can set any picture as wallpaper) Band: soft and smooth Price: best smart watch in this price (I got it in 2000) App: app working perfectly Heart rate, oxigen, bp, pedometer works nearly accurate"
5,Strip very Nice 8 days battery backup Bp and spo2 quick result Display clearity best All sensor reported quickly Over all in 2k best watch i have seen
5,Nice watch. Looking very good in my hand.And all functions are working well. So I'm fully satisfied with this product. Thank you Flipkart. I got it Rs1999
5,"Looks good and works great. Me and my partner purchased it to keep track on the steps we walk, cycling and swimming. It is really feature rich and very useful. It has created a healthy competition in the family. It does not allow your laziness to dominate your lifestyle. Must buy to keep watch on fitness...steps, sleep, heart beats, oxygen, BP, etc. Connect easily with mobile and syncs all the details in no time."
5,"Best smart watch at this cost of 2500........ thank u boat, and flipkart bcz they sent first wrong pincode and resent on 1day late........ i believed on flipkart bcz of quality based on the time, now a days good response from flipkart ekart also good response"
5,An excellent watch at this price point . The sensors are reasonably accurate. A wonderful value for money device. Prompt delivery by flipkart
4,"Good one with best price, but the BP monitor is not that much accurate, SPO2 nd HRt is accurate compared with medical divice."
5,Awesome watch for this price I have used it for two months now. Display is super smooth and touch is good. Display is bright so no issues in sunlight. Battery comes for more then 2 weeks. Looks much better in person then in the photo. Looks premium watch.
5,I like the watch but it is not supporting some apps which i wish it could. It would help me if someone can touch base to see if this can be sorted. Some of the features like BP and Oxygen check are really useful
5,"Value for money, minimum 10 days battery backup nyc look good features over all I can say this smart watch is best in this range so guys this is good option üëç"
5,The brand should add a call picking and dailing features as a normal smart watch of 500 ruppes has this feature Although the watch is nice all functions are good love it..
3,Worth the price and blue color looks way better than black... Its an affordable good quality smartwatch.
2,First of all device should hav at least some battery inside the box.  Pros: 1 Most sensors at this price (at least on paper). 2 Nice build quality especially Strap and dial material.  Cons : 1 Heart rate sensor shows 15-20 beats more than actual (in my case). 2 SPO2 values differs upto 10-15 % every time when checked continuosly. 3 Step count is not as accurate as my MI band 5. 4 OS is not furnished right now.
5,Nice product and design very beautiful work very nice
5,absolutely amazing product display is very good looks are amazing hoping updates will be soon overall a must buy product accuracy is absolutely nice superb product please buy
5,I liked this watch very much it's just worth it and perfectly splendid
5,Goood but calling notification was too slow if the manufacturing company is see my review so please improve the calling notification upgrade so faster otherwise the product was best 5 out of 4.5
5,Super Amazing Product - worth buying - I only use it for running purpose and walkint purpose  Other features are not up to the mark like BP accuracy etc but it solves my purpose  I recommend it 100%  - A Happy buyer
3,Not Satisfied as much as expected.. screen was too small in real Incoming Call notification viewed so late by the time.. was not described at any video or details page.. Otherwise a good product in other things like sports activities.. Not worth to buying this..
2,No option for always on display. No option for touch awake. Not nearest to accurate readings but shows decent readings that could help in maintaining worst health. Battery life reduces on using watch to the fullest pace therefore lasting till 5-7 days not more than that. Flip sensor not very responsive and seems flickering sometimes. Have to reset watch for at least three to four times to be calibrated. Better to get replacement or refund if you face minor issue.  Watch needs firmware and sof...
5,Very good especially spo2 it‚Äôs showing almost accurate in present pandemic I hope it‚Äôs very useful for everyone and also the device weight its too low there is no feeling of wearing a watch finally its worthy device and I‚Äôll update the device battery backup after 15 days üòçüòç
5,Very good watch loved it üëç nice display and the band is also very comfortable I also loved the different background we can chose from phone photo and the in built background best watch in the market üòÄ in this price range i recommend to buy it..
3,"As design wise gd not so much ..battery backup also ok but the accuracy of spo2 and bp its not gd ..some times spo2 91 and after refreshing its 99 so I dont like this watch ,its just like a digital watch ..and some entertaining things in in it ..thats it ..I think u understand what I am saying"
5,"Boat smart watch nice and decent product in this price range. The functionality is amazing and display quality is also good, the battery life is not so good compare to other smart watches this is the main drawback, the battery life comes for 5-6 days for 1 full charge. Belt quality good and smooth"
5,Build quality is good and battery backup is osam ...   But we expect other features like sim and tf card port etc like less priced smartwatches had....   But this watch doesn't have those facilities.... But still good to go with this product bez it's having excellent battery backup... 1 charge can use upto 10 days....
3,the product is good in term of features and look but the quality of the product not much good also the screen is not good
3,"Display size is good. But except walking steps all other readings like BP, Heart beat etc are not at all accurate. All the time, it shows the same values...Just 2 unit differences only it shows...I have Honor 5 smart watch, it's almost accurate and touch panel also was good. Not very happy with the purchase....Hope, Boat would correct by updating its app and make me happy"
5,"So finally 2 days of uses i truly say to everyone that This watch is so good in this budget Blood oxygen , blood pressure and heart rate monitor perform very good.  98% accurate result Good battery life on continue heart rate you can easy use it 5 days  Splash and water proof  If you want more detailed So visit my you tube channel  TECH PRO NG"

1,With the recent recent firmware update (version 6) The watch gets rebooted everytime we try to sync the data. It causes too much battery drain and hell lot of irritation. Hope the next update arrives soon in which it will be fixed. Battery also drains rapidly. I was getting anywhere between 7 to 9 days before the firmware update. Now it directly fell to 3 days

My watch going restart again and again when i open their App. Because when it start to synchronize the watch is switching off and then on automatically. I think it is the main issue that must be solve. Another issue is i noticed that whenever this watch arriving in sale after that boat is giving you new clock styles which is still low in amount so why boat not giving or updating ...

5,"Nice smartwatch. All functions heart rate, blood oxygen level, blood pressure working fine. Relax function very useful. Apart from that pedometer to count steps, sleep activity, 8 sports activity provided. Talking of watch faces, as of now there are 35 cloud watchfaces provided. Hope more will be added."
3,This boat is having only limited watch faces in that only 2-3 are good Nose watch is having more watch faces Wallpaper watch face is not having option of changing clock place or size Need to give more dark watch face The watch didn't look good when you see it in sun light not. Brightness Screen size can be seen Only two colour straps
1,"Not satisfied as much as expected Third class product, battery life was no.longer remain. The screen is very small useless product cheap quality watch cheap quality silicon strap.Not much comfortable in wrist"

5,Must buy productü§ôüî•
1,Waste of money. Except time rest of the features don't work properly. When connected to app watch and app synchronisation continues in loop. BP readings are totally wrong. There is an option to calibrate BP monitor but it doesn't work as app and watch keep on synchronising. Steps are reduced while the watch synchronises with app.
5,Superbüëå
5,Quick delivery by fkart. Working so well accurate results and call notifications are good
4,"As expected Budget smartwatch Battery will drain in 4-5 if heavily used HRM,spo¬≤,Bld pressure (only for reference) Every other feature is awesome Premium look Boat pro gear application need lot of modification"

3,The watch is best ...i bought it for 1600 in big billion days...overall the watch is good the main problem is it has some connectivity issue means sometimes this watch automatically got disconnected with the phone and i have to reconnect it with the phone  Otherwise i love this watch‚ô•Ô∏è
4,Nice product

1,"Worst experience faced in boat watches,please dont purchase this watch highly disappointed 2999 wasted"
1,Battery backup not good . it's stay only 3 day. This results come in a month .bad product
1,Its giving very pathetic product and not working anymore showing charging while on hand without any charging cables
1,I got the product on 10th august and started using it. As per its claims to be water proof I did not open it while washing my hands and bathing and since 3 days its stopped working. The device after being fully charged comes to 0 within seconds and shuts down. I dont even know if a waranty was given or not. Any way may be the price makes a difference in quality of the product. Absolutly regret buying this item.
1,It totally stopped working . Charger don't work. Waste of my money .
5,Good
1,After 20 days of buying it switched off automatically and now it is waste
1,After 1 month charging not working. Problem with watch not the charger
5,Worth for money I love it
1,"One Word Review - USELESS Cons - --- Watch-App Integration is pathetic and so is the app. --- Calls, msgs and Notifications don't show up when connected with all permissions allowed. --- Display feels like the one used on phones in 2005 --- Raise Gesture takes long time to show time --- Steps increase even when you're in a car or any transport , so forget abt tracking your daily activities  Pros - --- Sensors are accurate ( accept the one that counts steps) --- Size good for people with..."
1,"Worst smartwatch . I have purchased two smart watches on the same day .One stopped working after 25 days , another stopped working after 40 days . waste of money."
1,Absolutely pathetic watch. No data is shown accurately. It is just a waste of your money. The worst is the ProGear app that you would have to connect with the watch. Mark my word; never ever go for this watch. You will end up wasting your money like me too.
1,It's doesn't work showing the data which is heart bete and oxigen levels and blood pressure... It's not showing the data of our body... Waste

1,"No customer support. Watch reboots automatically multiple times a day as soon as you try to sync data with mobile app and all your days activity gets cleared and reset to ZERO. Don't waste your money on this, spend some more and get some other good quality product."
5,Nice one
1,Call notification system is very poor. It doesn't support even 5 meter distance. BP measurements are not working. It takes a lot of time and then gets declined.
1,When you set wallpaper face Time settings automatically change in 24 hours format no 12 hours format available and claud face are not good

5,Bad impression call function not praporly work
5,Cool awesome v nice
3,Product worth for 2K. Not more than that. Inner dial size is smaller. Will give detailed review after few days of use.
1,Very bad connectivity. I went for walk in the morning and completed 7k steps in morning wald. Once I reached home I synchronised with mobile and after synchronisation it shows 470 steps. If I have to calculate steps manually or I have to carry my mobile all the time then what is the benefit of spending money on watch. Very bad app and poor connectivity.

1,Don't buy this watch. It's like a kids watch. Watchfaces are very worst and design is very worst. Customise watchface is also non sense. U can see only time in custom watchface. This watch is simply the waste of money.  Step count will show 60 steps without u move. Heart rate is based on algorithm. Blood oxygen and blood pressure is showing random values. Simply it's a cheat not a smartwatch.  Don't buy and cry. I believed boat but disappointed alot. Hope u all understand why the price is r...
1,Not working
1,"The only issue is, sync with app. When I try to sync after my activity, it‚Äôs erase data from my watch which I can not retrieve again. To be more clear, I have started walking activity and complete around 1hr with 5km around. Post the activity I tried to sync my app with watch and the entire activity got erased in my watch and it‚Äôs not update seen in my app (boat ProGear)also. Happening every time when I try to sync.

1,Very cheap material.... Please don't buy and waste your money
1,Very bad product. Find my phn didn‚Äôt wrk. Only vibration no ringtone during use fine my phn features.
1,Very worst
1,Waste of money üíµ
1,Don't buy products in flipcart very bad
2,Wast of money.
1,Get the Mi Fit Band instead. The reading accuracy is pathetic in this one.
2,Watch Is slow to operate Motion sensing is slow... No O2 sensor in it no bp monitor.watch faces are not properly deaigned..
2,Not worth it.
1,"Couldn't connect whatsap notification, nor call notification... Tried everything."
2,"After one month Bluetooth is not working, bad product"
2,The actual display in smaller than shown in the images.
4,Good enough for the price 1999. Dont buy if the price is more than 1999
5,"Good product, but cost is higher than functions"
5,Got it for 1999 and current price is 2999 OMG
4,Nice watch must watch
5,"The sensors are not that accurate but this model has all the facility like spo2, Blood pressure monitoring etc. The cost was 1999 when I bought, now it is little costly."
4,"If you are looking it for BP monitoring, dont buy it , readings are wrong. Otherwise very good"
4,The blood pressure and spo2 function dosent work properly. If u r buying mainly for those i would recommend to buy another watch
5,Lovely watch.... Value for money
5,Worth it
4,Sensors not really giving real figures. Step counter counts about 100 even if u walk upstairs 20 steps. These require to be fixed. Rest the battery and design is awesome. Can buy for relative figures but not actual.
5,Worth to buy in this budget... battery is good.. but screen size is not satisfied.. Otherwise good watch
5,Nice product
5,Osm watch!! Thankyou flipcart üòá
2,Blood pressure and blood oxygen is not accurate.
2,"If you want a smart watch just for the sake of it, go for it. Not satisfied at all with it features. Activity tracker is totally a waste it doesn't give any indication it is not even remotely correct. Display and touch is also not great."

5,This product i am buy only 1999 in this price best smart watch But screen is small
4,Good
4,Nice product. Use Indian product üëçüëç
5,Nice product in 2000 rs.  Battery backup is average i had charge 100% and now at 4th day it is 36%. If you use it very much then it will drain quickly in 3 to 4 days. Although in normal usage it will run upto 8 days.  Display is very nice . Touch response is also nice  Disclaimer : if you have low budget of 2000 to 2500 then you should go for it is better than noise colourfit pro. And if you have 3000 to 4000 budget i suggest you amazefit bip U
3,Overall watch is good but screen size and boat progear app dissappointing.
2,i used it for more than a week and i found this watch is very normal with minimal features.. spo2 and blood pressure heart rate monitor they all not working properly

4,Its good but vibration not continues its good j can go for ot in this price stylish watch
4,Good in this price.
1,Every thing good bt connecting problem is very poor Every tym disconnecting so i return this watch after 24 use
4,"Only 5 watch faces can be stored in the watch. App is also not user friendly ,we have to download watch faces from the cloud storage each time inorder to change the watch face regularly and only less number of watchfaces as compared to other watches. Pros Light weight Good design. Value for money (Rs 1999) Cons Not able to know whether watch is connected to app or not. In External wallpaper time and date are blurred. App and watch faces should be improved."
5,Good enough Display should be big & more features should be add
4,Good.
1,Spo2 not proper work Other sensor ok
1,Don't expect it better go for Amazefit. This display quality looks worst ever

5,"I never thought of a smartwatch with so many features in this price segment, There are lots of reviews regarding this watch I don't know why people are complaning about the activity tracking, guys you people are getting more than enough. Human wants are unlimited but do satisfy yourself what you have."
1,I checked SPO2 by stopping blood circulation. I tied wrist with thread tightly. I checked spo2. Still it's showing 98-99%. My father checked BP in it. showing No BP. My father stopped taking BP tablet. When my father checked with other BP machine it shows BP. Misleading products are dangerous. It is just a watch. Don't trust for any thing else.
1,Very bad smart watch in this price range not worthy
1,"Connectivity is very bad, call & notifications not showing after connected"
1,Item not for ratting ... it's bad product ...and sencer not working properly... very very bad impression on boat

1,it's waste watch..it doesn't showing WhatsApp app & message app in SNS system in mobile app so we can't get any message notifications on watch

4,"The watch is perfect but the issue is with their app. Everytime you reconnect with your app, the watch gets reset to 0. That is whatever activity you have done will go to 0. It will show as if you haven't done any activity all day. That is the only hectic thing other than that the watch is perfect it gives everything accurately. Go for it but I wont suggest their app."

2,Boat app doesn't feature upload other apps...
5,Nice watch
5,Its a nice watch ...üëçüíØüß≠
4,Simple and Nice watch... Good choice for learning....
3,Its good but we can't make calls by it and can't give reply to the messages And it automatically reboot when it been synchronising
2,I adress to everyone who want to buy this watch I had ordered this and claim refund for this in two days many more issues in this watch 1.poor activities tracking 2. Poor connectivity with pro gear app of boat every time synchronisation the steps gets short which you walk 3.bp monitoring ‚ù§Ô∏è rate monitoring are not uptomark 4. Battery was ok 5. Music connectivity is poor 6. Sms not able to view and calls are coming not picked through watch
3,Blue tooth keeps continuously disconnects from phone and it is the one of the biggest disadvantage
5,Awesome Watchüòäüòò i loved it
4,Average
2,"(PS: Personal Opinions and Observations after a months usage) Built Quality and interface is exactly same as Go Noise Colour fit pro 2 Battery life is good, lasts a week  Hepatic feedback is very poor, you tend to miss the notifications Notifications are delayed, there are times where notifications were delivered after 24 hours The app is very poor, it will sync your watch everytime you open the app It takes ages to set the watch faces Heart Rate monitor and Oxygen levels are very much off as..."
5,It is gorgeous... Battery power hulk... I like it ...
3,No watch faces
5,Gud
5,"""Value for money"" Display size would have been a little more big like covering the entire screen except that i love the watch it's really worth buying for this money compared to realme and noise smartwatch"
5,Its very nice watch ..and good looking
3,Good. But Still I Can't Customise Watch Face....
3,Call alert function not working
5,It's a best watch in this range.
5,"First of all, lightning quick delivery by Flipkart.. Product is really good and comfortable at the moment. I add more points as I use product for few more weeks... But at this moment my impression is that, it will serve the purpose... Step count accuracy is huge plus point at the moment.."
4,Gud
5,awesome
5,Very nice product
4,Good job
5,screen guard should given with the pack.
5,Very good
4,Best product
5,Very nice
3,Stylish and gud looking but feature wise not good. Oxymeter- Bakwas Bp- ekdum fake Heart rate- okay Activity sensors are of no use I'm posting it after a month of purchase. If you want to show off then only go for it.
4,Nice display. Value for money.

4,Nice
5,The product is delivered within 24 hours and my son is very happy üôÇüôÇ
5,Very Very good product üëå on this price ‚åö
4,It can be considered an entry level wearable tech. Don't expect precise outputs. For first time buyers of smartwatch it is the best option. And for me an extra point for being an Indian company.
4,Very good
4,I get this watch only on 1999 rs so it's worthy for me. and value for money. Watch look is premium and Battery life is good but the activities control such BP monitoring is bad and rest of all things in is absolutely fine.
5,Exlent watch nice product
4,Nice watch of this budget Light weight Battery capacity 10 days
3,Nice
5,"Worth a buy.. I have been using this for more than a month and found no flaw.. battery backup is awesome. No second thought, go for it"
5,Comfort and stylish design....Nice battery life
2,"Watch is good but App is worst. watch tracks the step count, but when we try to sync with the App, suddenly all steps get reset and go to zero. This is very disappointing. As a smart watch step counter is a very basic feature and that is also not syncing correctly.  Giving 1 star due to the App, this is really annoying. Even automatic heartrate monitor doesnt seem to work."
5,Good one
4,Good watch
5,"Just good. Sometimes bluetooth can't sync the device i had to Unbind then Bind again. Watch homescreen are less. Battery backup is good. Sleep track is somewhere accurate. But Modes are good by app, as it does not have gps the cycling, biking, through the app shows the location of travelling."
5,Best watch
5,Support watch vary good
4,One word value for money in low budget
3,Good value for money. Has no issues except the blood pressure sensor. It's highly inaccurate. So if u want to test ur blood pressure then don't buy it. Otherwise no issue. Also to UI is quiet laggy but it is acceptable for the price. Also several improvement is required in the app
4,Nice product in budget
2,No call notification
1,Don't buy this product. Worst experience. Activity tracking is very poor. App is too worst. No synchronization

5,Value for money... In 2k range boat is providing multiple function. Look is awesome.. I will suggest to buy if your budget is not high.
4,Looks good with nice features
5,A best smartwatch in this price
2,Worst connectivity with mobile app. App working too bad
3,Watch is good. But boat gear app is lagging. Synchronizing time watch gets restart and all activity gets erased. So nothing on record. It's better to use only watch without using app. Hope software updates solves this bug
3,Not bad okay but please add to new futures
5,Superb products and Superb Fast delivery
5,"Its really awesome, I gifted to my hubby, he was really surprised and satisfied with this, he felt very happy, thank you"

1,"Review after a day:  Built quality is cheap not sure why mrp is set at 6000 bucks. Features are nice only if accurate. Accuracy is not ok, not sure every time I measure BP of any of my family member it gives single common reading, 119/74."

5,"Money for value, good product"
3,Everything is good except bluetooth connection. Every morning it gets disconnected and I have to turn off my mobile bluetooth and turn it on to connect to watch.
5,"*Product is satisfied for this price  *Battery life is good, I got more than 10 days  *One the negative is that, only 3 watch faces are available,"
3,watch is awesome but did not fulfilled its promise of 100 faces. Still waiting for the update
4,Good üëç
5,Nice
1,Small display and there is issue in syncing with mobile app. Only 4 faces are unbuilt with the watch and you can not add more faces through app. Pls do not go for it.

5,Good nice to buy nice price
5,Nice product in a price range.
5,Excellent watch compared to others in this price range....no issues faced till date...... approx 10 battery life after using it full day.....buy without any hesitation
4,Nice watch but gets disconnected again & again
3,"Very poor packing. Flipkart should improve such type of unprofessionalism. I got the order today with very poor packing condition.  Look is good, and for this price range you can‚Äôt expect more. Graphics and notifications are seems below average. App is working smoothly . Size and weight is perfect. Touch quality is okay for this price. Anyone who is looking for a budget smart watch; go for it."
3,Didn't except so low grade belt very harsh on skin. Don't have any call alert feature and very delayed notifications alert. Screen isn't so premium on touch feels cheap. Music control doesn't looks premium and sometime doesn't work. Doesn't worth for money.
1,Dont Buy this watch Application and watch connection very poor Not getting call and other notification in watch go for another watches
2,Poor blue tooth connectivity and faulty sensors.
4,Very nice with many amazing features.. thanks Flipkart üòå

5,Very good product I love üíû it boat smartwatch
3,I love it
4,Screen size is smaller. As it seen in Images All over good design. They should also provide 1 screen guard with this Watch.
4,Supar ‚ù§Ô∏è. Boat is Pawar full üåù Brand .. boat ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå
3,Awesome but improve display quality
4,Nice product at this price got it at just rs 1550.
5,Nice ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
1,So in love with this smartwatch. Makes my life more focused. Perfect size for small wrists. Those with small wrists blindly go for it.
2,"At this price range this is not meet its value. Approximately 1500 price range is good. I was very excited before it's buy, I ignored so Manny product such as noise, realme mi, apple etc. I am very disappointed üòûto this product."
5,Nice and awsome under this price
5,After unpack this product You should install the Boat Pro Gear APP from play store to set the time of this watch. After binding with phone via Bluetooth the watch is ready to use. And this is great product.
4,Every thing is awesome but I was expecting some large size of touch display 1.3 cm looks like some ordinary type.
4,I am buying this watch rs-1999. So value for money. I like and Love this watch
2,Connecting problem issue
2,"Disconnected frequently with phone, sometime notification not received even phone connected, shown sigle notification/msg/whatsapp msg thrice in watch. Wake up gesture not working properly."
5,"Small in Value, Not in features  Pros-All features available with this watch Spo2 Heart rate monitor Blood pressure monitor Menstrual cycle Breathing exercises with alerts Multiple watch face Own pics watch face  Cons Display gives troubles sometimes but manageable looking at price.  Got it on deal @1800"
1,"SPO2 continuous monitoring not available, also real time data of SPO2 not showing on application most of the times.   Worst product if you want to purchase it for SPO2 monitoring."
4,Watch is absolutely good for the price heart rate monitoring is perfect. Overall good performance
5,Awesome product...üòç Little issue in activity tracking and skipping tracks...otherwise good Display is not that great...‚úåüèª
1,Bluetooth connectivity is very poor.. Flipkart customer support for this product is also poor.. Look like wasted 2k
1,Battery permanence is very poor battery capacity is only one day 24 hours worst
2,Data is not accurate... showing wrong data of BP. No sleep data capturing. If you want to buy for time display go for it
1,Ordinary watch plz don't buy... there is no additional function
5,Very good performance watch
1,this is low cost watch and I love this
5,Awesome
4,Nice but disconnected problemas
1,Almost waste of money. Every time when it's Bluetooth disconnected it doesn't connect automatically and after reconnecting its call alert feature requires 5-10 minutes to enable.  Another drawback in this watch is about step counter feature. It calculate your kms even when you are on a vehicle.
5,Thankyou flipkart
4,Nice
5,Very nice product
1,Bed product I was return this product next day
1,I got nothing inside

5,superb product. No need to go for Apple Watch. This watch is worth buying. Go for it
1,"Not a single sensor shows accurate reading, high tolerance in readings."
1,Worst quality
1,"waste of money.the call is not connecting.pla,dont buy"
1,Send defective watch
5,Good smart watch ........
1,The watch is horrible .I am not able to set watch faces and I replaced one time as the problem occurred.But after replacement the same problem occured in new product
3,Just for show nothing other than SpO2 is accurate..Can't pick the call.only call Disconnect option.It was more of a show watch or call it a healthband no real smartwatch
4,"Good product, nice features"
3,the product is good at the price but there are many bugs like whenever i am synchronising the watch it is getting reboot. I have also replaced the product but then too same issue and don't know when boat will resolve it
3,The app should be improved

3,It's okay but battery back up only 5 days and face watch not suitable pre install and cloud so need to suitable face watch  I give only 3 star
3,Distance accuracy is bad..

5,"At this price range, its a product which gives you the most necessary features and good battery life with nice accuracy.Mostly recommended!! Don't think too much just go for itüòÉ‚ù§üëåüëçüëç"
5,"Best in the market, Just go for it blindly ..!"
1,boat progear app disconnecting frequently. Not showing any of the notification and watch face not synching. Very bad experience
3,"If you want to use it for activity tracking then please don't buy, it always gives wrong data and you can't use it for swimming. The pathetic one is the notification it always gives notification after I read out from my mobile and that too with the irritating vibration."
2,not fill to watch is brand
1,Nice product thanks you Flipkart
2,With low price this watch has no feature to upload wallpaper face which is the main feature of this watch Boat is cheating customers with low price.
5,Awesome Watch
4,Good
5,Nice üëç
1,Spo2 not accurate Heart rate is not accurate Blood pressure is a joke. Not up to mark with steps counting. It's a disaster. And now you reduce the price to 1999. It's not even worth 500.
5,Very nice watchü•≥ü•≥
5,Best smartwatch.....‚ù£Ô∏è
3,I think in this price range it's good as smart watch. Tracking is not perfect but average. App should be update because it's need update as soon as possible. Screen resistance is so bad. It scratch whenever touched some where
5,Value for price
4,All most average products
1,"I'm writing genuine feedback after using this product for months, it's totally waste battery backup stands maximum 3 days ago some time touch not working properly I never expected this my worst product from reputed brand like boat.

Battery backup is also good,  Drawbacks : Faces are not 300+ _ they are just similar designs with different color schemes SP02 tacker needs optimisation and calibration When using sports mode _ you can't access to other features like music controls or camera controls or SPO2 measurement"
5,Awesome product üëç
5,"I like this product. Its very smoothly work, but it's don't insert Sim card and SD card."
4,"Great battery backup up üòâ, Nice looks nd features Value for money ü§ëüí∞"
5,Good
5,Battery Backup is very good.. Reviewing it after 7 days use.. More features than realme Watch (1).. Accuracy is about 99% of heart rate and SPO2.  Got it in Early Bird sale on flipkart @ 2999 only..
5,Great product in this price range.
5,Best
5,Superb quality smartwatch..
5,Nice product Must buyüòÉ.
1,"Connecting is an majure problem, music control has issues some time it's working but most of the time it don't, camara control is notwork, heart beat training and spo2 works, workout training is started to malfunction, within 3 days, so much issues we can find in this product."
5,Super...
5,Best watch in this price range...don‚Äôt buy noise and boat watches...These realme watch look like permium and best in quality...Heart rate and SP02 sensors are 90% accurate...So many watch faced...Smooth working with my apple iphone Xs Max...Nailed it...Pls go with this ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
2,The product is not worth. It's cheap plastic. Activity tracking is not accurate. SPO2 readings are not accurate. Only display is bright and battery seems to fine. Casing is made cheap plastic. Not worth. I should have gone with Noise Fit.
5,Good watch

1,You make fool to me and give cheap product. Now i never ever order in flipkart and suggest to other for not to order in flipkart
2,"Talking honestly, I have purchased many products from flipkart and for the first time I am unsatisfied. I always do complete research before buying any product by reading specifications and reviews. This product, realme Watch 2 is completely a waste of money. I bought it for activity tracking and it is so inaccurate that it is showing my SpO2 level of 75% to 80% every time. Also, it tracked only 84 steps even when I walked 200 steps by counting. It shows constant heart beat of 72 to 85 wheth..."

I have compared results multiple times, everytime it makes me upset. I have purchased it for my cycling activity. I ride 15 km and it shows only 6 km. (After using mobile gps as well).

1,"Step counts are just for sake, you shake your hand and it counts it as a step. Most of the time display lags to wakeup and notifications are sometimes received and sometimes not. Still do not receive notifications for many applications even after allowing in the application. Standup is always on, after 1 week sleep monitor stopped working"

Step tracking is not accurate even start counting while riding and driving..  In gym I used it's workout mode and after 15 minutes it got hanged.  Expectations was so high while purchasing after seeing review and advertising but not fit to my perception..  It could have been more better...  Can't say wastage of money but even not value for maney.  3500 bucks are...

3,"The watch by itself is all good. Battery life, Build, Display, everything is spot on, even the app is all nice but there is issue with Bluetooth connectivity. Even when the phone is connected and receiving notifications, still the app will show *sync failure*. I either have to restart the watch or restart bluetooth on my phone for a fix. This is a bit annoying. This happens if the watch remains un-connected with the phone for a long time and then we try to connect back. It's not seamless. Sin..."

5,Awsm . I'm not a professional but using of li'l bit xperience must say that best Dslr in a best budget.perfect for a beginners.image quality is too good.thanx to Canon thanx to Flipkart & also thanx to Ecom xpress for perfect delivery.

5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"

5,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
5,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
5,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
4,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
5,"It's a great deal, images are good, go for it, nice camera for beginners,images videos were amazing, if your budget was less then 30k then go for it don't think to much, I personally liked it. Thanku flipkart for this and for 1 day delivery."
5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,this is the best DSLR for beginer the price is the best DSLR best for the beginer I am really happy for this camera
5,Nyc osm fantastic Fabulous pictures quality ls vary vary good in this price range I m gone for 5 star thank you flipkart thank you so much for this camera
5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
5,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
5,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
5,As like always Canon is perfect in all manner.. super pick by this price range. loved it
5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
4,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
4,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
4,"Best Entry Level DSLR in this range. My first DSLR. Loved It. Good delivery, thank you Flipkart !"
5,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"
5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
4,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
5,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
4,it's awesome gift... always thnkful papa..I feel very happy .. it's good working...and very clean photo..
5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
5,Good quality product for the price. Photo quality is commendable and iinbuilt wifi is an advantage as it can be used to wirelessly use camera for capture and data transfer. Even the video quality is very nice at1080p.

4,Good 1
5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
5,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."
5,Good to start
5,"Got it for 20k flat ! Excellent product for beginners and learners ! It even comes with a free learning courseware subscription the box ! Only thing tou need to take care is that the Mount ring lacks steel reinforcement, so lens changes need to be carefully done...."

5,Budget camera
4,Nice
3,Too good
1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
4,good

4,Camera is amazing. But i didn't get memory card and bag with it so a lil bit disappointed. But overall the camera is awesome Ho for it i got is for 22k I'd suggest you to buy it in big billion days you may get it for 18 to 19k rupees.
1,If you're Planning to buy this camera for video shoot then you are going to do a big mistake because it's video quality is too much poor .
5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
5,Blur system is very good
4,Good
5,Good product

5,Good
5,Very good photo
1,Wast of mony
5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
4,Excellent product
5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
3,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
4,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
5,Good product
4,Excellent product the picture is much more good
5,Very good
5,Nice
5,Good for entry level. I bought is super cheap at 19k. Wait for offers.. if want a bit better one go for 1500d

4,"Very good quality product with non stm lens. Quite fast autofocus but the focus motor makes considerable noise during videography.Plastic lens mount makes it a bit less durable. There's no separate power button and viewfinder diopter , it's of a bit problem. Nevertheless , it's the most affordable dslr in the market , and it can compete with any entry level dslr. Thus it's the best pick for a beginner."

5,Good
2,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."
5,Good
1,Worst camera.  Not good at all.  Money waste only.

4,Best in class for a beginner
3,The build quality is ok .....plastic but looks good . For a entry level camera its best in this price range . But you want a serious photography career then nikon is best .....the natural colour is better in nikon. It has one issue sometimes you can't able to take picture with flash mode on in Auto mode.....still I m struggling to solve this .....its a bad experience with this dslr. But picture quality is good for a entry level dslr.
5,Value for money! I loved it ???

5,Best Product for beginners Excellent product
4,"It's a great entry level dslr. If you are new into the photography or video making then you may go for this product. But i would suggest you to buy Canon 1500D, if you can. After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

5,Awesome product fast printing and scanning is also good and it is easy to setup but it is not wireless otherwise awesome
5,Excellent .. printer Hp desk jet 2331 . And you can must buy it üòâ.. i am really happy to my new printer..i think best low range best printer Hp .. Thanks and Thanks for Flipkart customer support ..
3,Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .
3,This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..
1,"Pathetic product, worst ever printing and scanning quality. Do not recommend this product to anyone, my 10 year old printer still works better with better quality output. Spend some extra money to get a better product else your money is wasted."

5,Nice products üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
1,very bad product... it shows low ink after printing arounrd 50 pages and ink cartridge is very costly around 2000 rs and prints only 100 pages go and buy another printer
5,Superb product
3,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..
4,Good product
4,I like the printer look so much but the cartiage ink was empty In 50_60 pages or hp called it is only for trial purpose .or the speed of print out from pc is very slow main thing is the speed of print out from pc is very slow by the way the printer look and the photocopy speed is also good thank you

2,"Not a successful printer, finished cartridge just after printing 15-20 pages, Printing Quality is fine but very costly, I wouldn't recommend to buy"
1,"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose because these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy ink tank printers as they are too efficient"

1,"I have a Macbook Air. It is now 3 hrs that i am trying to make the new HP Printer 2331 work. Checked all tutorial and youtube videos, all ends with HP Smart application unable to detect the printer through USB. I feel like a fool to have wasted time on this. Surprisingly the HP warranty page shows this serial number is covered under extended warranty which started on Feb 26 2021. I purchased the printer on May 17th, this should have 1 year warranty. This is the 2nd time i have faced this Warr..."

5,"- It is just a superb device in this price range. I am not sure why many have rated negative. - I am using this from past 1 month and there is no issue found. Print/Scan/Copy all are working excellent. - You will get a wide range of options as input while using the scanner. Also, the print quality is good. - It will be slow in printing as this is a DESKJET printer. This is normal. - If you want faster print you have to spend more for the laser printer. Spend money and get faster speed."

4,"Canon G3012 is the same as G3010 but with two extra black bottles of ink. So, this review is applicable for both the models. The flipkart delivery was on time and packing was satisfactory. Coming to the Printer.... The setup of easy. I was waiting for the Canon guy to come and install but then I decided to install it myself. Took me 15 mins to install. The print quality is satisfactory. Wireless printing setup was a bit typical but is a one time hassle. I took out some b/w and colour prints ..."
5,Very Nice Product Printer is fast and smooth colours are good in compare to other printers in the market The big plus point of buying Canon printers that they have seprate individual cartage for black and colour ink so it saves money while servicing of the product and Extra black ink bottels are also a big advantage.
5,"Superb printer. Easy to install. During this Covid 19 scenario, we were reluctant to do the installation by someone else. I was wondering whether I could do it by myself. But I did it at ease. Almost a plug and play time. Only cartridge to be inserted and inks to be filled, the rest is well taken care of by the printer itself. I tried photo printing, colour printing and b/w printing. I am really impressed. Photo printing I need to purchase glossy paper I think for better effect. The price is ..."

4,"Good product. Tried installing myself watching YouTube videos, but was getting P03 error after all installation is done. Had to call in Canon engineer to resolve. Root cause was, something got struck in printer head path. Got to know that free installation service is provided by Canon, but not mentioned in the Flipkart description. So, do not try to install yourself. Just call Canon customer service, register warranty and ask for installation service.  Coming to the product, looks very deli..."
5,Satisfied with the printer. Color page cost I am not sure as Canon claims but I have yet to check it. Black ink for sure works quite well. Have taken around 50 pages and still the level of ink hasn't deteriorated.  Sending it after using it for almost 4 months. The printer is really worth. Color print quality is good though the color seems to fade away in few months (can be because i kept the photos in open stick to my refrigerator or the paper quality might not be really good.)
4,"I have been using Epson's L555 for close to 5 years and bought this as a backup. On the plus side I would say that the colour and scan speed is slightly better in comparison to the Epson. The sturdiness, fit and finish, print speed and noise levels could do with some improvement. In all I would rate this as a good product and am happy with it."
4,"Have been using this printer for last 2 weeks and it's good so far. The setup was ok, had some hiccups in configuring Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz (no 5 GHz), but could able to manage it with the USB connection, Support for Windows & Android is good, but doesn't support Airprint. The printing speed is good, since it's Inktank the yield is also good & advantage of having 2 additional Black ink bottles. The print quality & speed of both Black & Colour printouts are good, Scanning & Copier options are also goo..."

5,"Awesome printer loved it, Good for home use as well as medium work for office"
5,"A decent product, quick delivery from Flipkart, easy installation and setup. I was able to setup using the small (step-by-step) manual /user guide that came along. This came with 1 bottle ink of CMY and 3 bottled of Black ink.  I was instantly connected via my phone and started printing. Also downloaded drivers and software on laptop and printed test pages.  All good so far (after 5 days of using it)."
4,After a week usage  The printer is perfect for home and small office usage. The print quality was good as expected. But sometimes when we print whole black pages it sometimes spread maybe it is due to the season or what. Overall it is the best Inktank printer in market.
5,"Delivery was very fast by flipkart as usual. Printer is very good in terms of prinitng quality and installation. Installed by myself by reading the manuals. In this printer, I like very much to about this printer: Printing from mobile through wifi."
5,Printer is good better than HP faster and more responsive. No need to worry about software like in HP there are lot many things like cartridge protection and so on that you can disable but still its kind off mess. Software is easy and even you don't need one windows will automatically load drivers. Let's talk about printing part speed is good. Text is sharp if u have any issue like having lines just use the tool provided by canon clean and align printer head and it will fix it. Over all print...
5,Meets expectations. Installation process took half an hour in total. Simple steps are given for installation and no problem occurred while following them. I tried printing photos on glossy paper and it works perfectly well. Wireless printing working fine from laptop as well as mobile.
5,Awesome printer with great detailing in photo printing. Way better than epson and hp. Setting up wireless printing thorough mobile is easy but tricky while doing with laptop. Canon guy will help you to install it completely. Go blindly for this.
5,Very good printer. Quite easy to setup and takes printout from mobile so easily. Must have in these days if work at home and school at home.  Got 2 blank ink bottles extra which might help in getting more mileage out of the printer
5,"Review after 15 days use,excellent product, easy wifi options ,easy all printing options, good print quality,really superb product, Now I am trying to take print on pvc card.after that I will give one more review."
5,"Really Awesome, I satisfied with the quality given. Delivery from Flipkart is amazing. Easily we can do the wifi settings and once we do pairing life is easy. If you really searching for a color printer within Good Budget and Quality always Go for this model. Thank You CANON, Thank You Flipkartüëç"
4,"The printer is very good considering the price... Wireless connection is also very quick and easy.. ink tank is also built into the printer,not outside , saving a lot of space..But the built quality is worst , the top scanner cover literally comes out within a few weeks and it makes a lot of noise."

5,Best printer got it for approx 10000 print quality is superb and experiences zero issues while setting up the printer. no. of pages it prints in a single refill is just mind blowing. I also got two extra black ink bottles so no need to worry about ink refilling for a long time
1,I have got product with unproper sealing. Not satisfied at all. After 2 months of use I can say printer is very good. It's little bit slow. But it's normal with inktank printer. 1 star is for sealing of the packet and 5 star for the printer.

2,Photo print (Kodak Photo Paper) is not that great. Not even good. Rest print on plain paper is ok both monochrome and colour.
4,10 day usage review‚Äî- print quality on paper is good both color and black and white. Simple installation process. Two additional BK ink bottles... not sure when I can finish them üòÄ  Cons‚Äî printing 4*6 photos I have noticed that roller marks appearing if we closely observe... checked with Canon ... they told that the quality of the paper is not good... but I have used Kodak Glassy paper. Let me check with Canon paper. Vl update soon.

1,"After around 30-40 photocopies, the printer stops working. I have to turn off the printer and turn it on. After few color photos, the printer display shows error message E39, E26 etc and the yellow light is glowing. Within 15days, the printer is not working."
2,"Product is okay. But the wifi configuration is little bit tricky. Wifi configuration is also not explained properly either in their manual or on their website. The worst part is Service. I registered for the Installation as i couldn't do wifi configuration. It's been more than a week, no one came for installation. Still Waiting."

But it doesn't have auto-duplex printing facility. Hence I bought this one (Brother HL-L2321D) which has auto-duplex function (but it lacks scan/ copy functions). Build quality is better than my canon. Functions well. Easy to setup. I had great difficulty in connecting my canon printer to my PC."

4,"good product , sound need to be improved , sound is given by company but not useful. but all other things are vary good , i love this product in this range it is actually lcd moniter with led backlight, when black. colour comes on screen it looks too darker like almoded display"
3,"Pros - Slim border line style. Lightweight & compact. 3 year acer warrantee  Cons- Too much LED backlight,Back light leaks too much. Due to excessive LED backlight picture quality is whitissh.  Those who are used to use LCD monitor without backlight they will definitely make complaint.  I got replacement. But replacement was also had this quality issues. In fact it is not manufacturing defect. It is design error.  Sad thing is that Flipkart avoided to give refund by giving false assurances ..."
5,The product was great I am loving it and it's working properly and nice packaging nice monitor
4,Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.
5,Amazing work good quality display mind-blowing super fast delivery
4,Using this product for 2 months now and is truly worth the money.  The pixel quality is very clear and the menu options are very easy. The size of the Monitor is so big so as to give a theatre experience for movies and awesome experience for games.
5,I am writing this review after making fair and reasonable used the Monitor for 1 month.  The product quantity: The Acer monitor is a good quality monitor. I am satisfied with the product. It is running fine till date. It is promptly delivered as described in the Flipkart. I say my sincere thanks to Acer Team and Flipkart team.
5,This is a great product within its price range. I had initially trouble setting its colours since the instructions booklet writes meagerly about how to customise it to your needs. I used the computer gtaphics methods to make it function according to my requirements. I use it as a TV also since I have an internal TV tuner card. Though an LCD monitor its colours and 3D effect are stunning. It is an ace among monitors and a great value for money..I do hope it will give years of service. Thank y...
3,I am little bit angry. This is LCD Monitor not HD + LED described by your heading line.  Speaker have no sound.  Lastly I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è ... because LCD 19.5 inch good and fit with the price. Nice Packaging.  Thank you Flipkart.
4,"Good Picture Quality, great performance and wall mount feature is a added attraction but the screws for wall mount were not on the monitor and not in the carton...."
5,I bought this for Rs.5220 at an offer (including credit card discount). Worth for buying at this price compared to other brands. Good for official (work from home) and personal use. Acer is a good brand gives a better quality and I had a similar monitor which I have used for more than 10 years.
5,"Although the monitor is great, and very vibrant, I would like to suggest the seller to change the product detail as this monitor only support vga and hdmi input and not dvi as shown in pictures, and another thing, the mac resolution is 1344 x 728 and not 1600 x 900 as mentioned on the details page. Other than that, it's a very good monitor with a little wider fov."
4,perfect one ...but sound quality is not so good enough but can manage to hear a low audible voice well in this price it's an awesome gives flowless 60 Hz well if can manage to go a 2k would recommend ips screen those who are buying for gaming would be satisfied but would enjoy the gaming feeling well for using with setup box it's nice it's has HDMI VGA and 1 in and out 3.5mm jack
5,19.5 inches is correct not led its lcd overall this is best budget monitor no one cont give this price only flipkart can do. with in 48 hours got delivery thank you.
4,"I was looking for a low budget tv..Because of its low sound from inbuilt speaker, I just added an external speaker to its aux sound output and used it as a tv... For a small room it can use as a tv with good clarity..I got it for 3281Rs+ 644 super coins in bgb days"
5,Good product.. I got in a good package and works fine ..
5,"thank u so much for fast delivery from flipkart nice product , display quality is better in this price range"
4,Perfect n nice one monitor at this price. VGA and HDMI port both are working nicely. Inbuilt speakers sounds low but it is an extra bonus. working as TV with set top box through HDMI cable. very satisfied.
5,"nice product Led monitor branded support all systems flexible stand hdmi chord, audio chord, all is very superb thnxs flipkart"
4,"It was good doesn't look like a true LED. It's just LCD with LED Backlit. Using HDMI Cable brings a feel of full HD on the screen. But there is one defect that I don't like at all, as it was present in my last DELL monitor (about the same price range) too. It is that the screen is half dark on the upper half and light on the lower half. The more you tilt the monitor vertically up or down, the more you can see the differences."
5,Excellent product. Colour reproduction and clarity is good as per price. Some people are complaining about viewing angle. But viewing angle is not so much bad. I found little bit gap between bezel and panel at lower side. Ghosting problem was also there. So I requested replacement. Flipkart provided replacement. Panel gap was also for replaced item. But gap was in permissible let limit. I compared with my old Acer 18.5 monitor. Old one also have some panel gap. I think all Acer has some panel...
5,"Best monitor under Rs. 5,000. Has VGA, HDMI, Audio in and out connectivity, frequency supporting up to 60Hz. It has LCD display with LED backlight, and the display produces clear and sharp pictures with a Maximum resolution of 1366 X 768. This is not a 1600 X 900 resolution monitor. But I am happy with my purchase. A Happy Customer."
5,"I fall in love .Outstanding quality, outstanding base,HDMI support, speaker also but sound not like tv,actually nice product in this price range.value for money.anyone buy this product for monitor for desktop or side by side using as a tv."
5,"Best budget screen, works like a charm. Build quality is good as well."
4,"Product is satisfying,it is the best one for mid range but the speakers aren't that good and it is an lcd monitor so viewing from an different angle may result in colour change other than this the monitor is pretty good."
5,"I was looking for a led monitor with VGA+HDMI supported with in a range Rs4500 I order this during the lockdown 4.0 period, 17may2020 and i recieved on 25may2020. Overall Acer v196HQL is very good with vga+hdmi supported with in the price range. Big thumpsup to delivery timely. So go for it. just plug & play."
5,My experince with filpkart is very good and its products .acer moniter packing is very good .As product its good quality below 5000 with inbulit speaker.
5,good monitor as per this price range. res is 1366x768. colour is vivid. brightness an contrast is good. all over good for daily office works. but viewing angles are not good. delivery of the product is the next day of order. all over good for office works.
4,could have given 5 stars but the built in speaker is very bad..my phone's speaker is much better in comparision..display is pretty good given this budget range
3,the product is good and I recommend to buy this product excellent packing with fast Delivery in very next day
5,"the display of the product shows 19.5inch but actually it is 20inch...what an awesome resolution... there is hdmi, inbuilt speaker, just loved it...got super discount from flipkart....superb deal...must go for it...its truly LED... packaging of the product was super class with one extra cover outside....#love flipkart"
5,very nice product very nice display perfect programmer LED desktop I so many thank Acer brand
5,Nice monitor...very easy to install...good packaging. Perfect desktop monitor Bought it for 5565 ... I can not get such nice monitor at such good price with such good brand Acer and 3 years warranty too. and Wow Flipkart.
3,"Very low sound and looking good , not adjustable or move to suitable. Remaing is very good , not provide hdml cable, audio cable available"
4,"Plus point:- The picture quality is awesome the coulors are vibrant And the hdmi,vga works wellüëçüèªüëçüèªYou can buy it Minus point:- If you don't want to buy external speakers Don't buy it seriously it speaker's volume is very lo Even if you sit one inch away from the moniter The sound wil be not enough üòïüòï So don't buy it if you are not buying external speakers  Thank you"
4,Well done üëç good job works great on HDMI on VGA its does not meet the expectation üòå
4,product good clarity wise good but catalog enclosed in LCD.
5,"Excellent Best in the market, Best price.....i am happy with fkiokart...."
4,Wow great ü§© product at reasonable price with decent in built speaker.i would recommend this product when it's around 4k or below during sales.really worth the money only problem is viewing angle which kind of irritates rest all are fine
4,this monitor is awesome in good deal I got for 4.7k damn worthy product.its very useful for office work purpose and for home also use also. not for gaming.
4,Videos quality good and üîä low work reading mode available so good choice acer monitor
5,"Stunning perfect product from Acer. Top quality build, with built-in audio at best price. Top recommend product for desktop computers."
4,I will just write in small. I have researched a lot on the monitor and finally purchased it. it is cheapest monitor available with 1 brand name 2 inbuilt speaker 3 HDMI port however the issues are 1 screen is not ips led so veiwing angle is very restricted. 2 inbuilt speaker is very low output type. hardly hear when setting before cup. I some time use my external speaker. rest all well.
5,absolutely fabulous too good display and very good screen size I am totally satisfied with product. and hope same kind of service from flifkart and one more thing on the time delivery
5,"I've expected wide size, but ok. it is led monitor backlight. not full hd or hd ready. clarity is good. good visible angles. I suggest you go for lg monitor instead of this."
4,Very good display from near as well as far sight. Well the inbuit speaker is average with not much bass.
5,"The monitor is definitely worth the price. If you want an reasonable LCD/LED monitor with speakers, Acer is the best choice. Over HP, Dell etc. Fyi, the dimensions are not exactly 16:9 It's a bit more in length as compared to height. Speakers are decent enough for 1/2 person viewing. It's more of an office use monitor than a gaming/movie monitor. If you want those go for higher end models"
3,Product is Good but it is LCD Monitor i think.You can not see the image clearly from side view.only display will be clear if u sit in front of it.
4,"it's LCD with LED Backlit, along with TN Panel... it's not 1600√ó900.. but it supports HD videos.. overall at this ( around 4000/-) price it's a good product.."
5,it's good one and got on special price that make it more for me ...well go for it good product.....overall it's good product
4,this monitor is varry good package and fast delivery and courier service is varry good and monitor is varry good so i am happy thanks flipkart and sellers and acer

3,it's not hd+ display. it's only hd display. Flipkart should correct that otherwise those information makes no sense for any product.  Hdmi and vga both port available. Inbuilt speakers are there with average quality. If single person wants to watch a movie those speakers good enough.  I connected my firetv stick with it and its works like a charm. Inbuilt speakers supports the firetv stick.
5,outstanding. money efficient item.
5,Good Product
1,The product has a dead spot on the monitor. But when claimed for replacement they said it is not a manufacturing defect. Don't buy this product. Flipkart is not giving importance to customers. Now I want to use a new monitor with this defect.

5,good product. i love this
4,Nice product in low amount
2,"Would recommend going for a monitor of smaller size with same resolution, or same/larger size with higher resolution. The max resolution for this monitor (1366 x 768) is too low for it's physical size. It makes text unclear, like zooming in to a low quality photo. The large width of the monitor is wasted because you can basically see as much content as on your laptop, just zoomed across a larger screen."
5,Super monitor Awesome Performance
2,"don't buy this monitor at all- pros:- 1)it is a colour monitor(that's all it has, nothing else) cons:- 1) so much of backlight bleeding 2) worst viewing angles even if you move a little from it you will see lack screen. you most see into the screen perpendicularly to see the colours. 3)it is written in description that the resolution is 1600√ó900 but actually the resolution is 1366√ó768 i don't expect such misleading information from Flipkart."

5,gud product....  I got the original one ....
4,very nice products.
1,Monitor display not satisfactory. Very poor viewing angle both vertical and horizontal. You can't recognise any face if you are not sitting infront of the monitor. Not expected from Acer brand. Availability of HDMI port along with VGA port is attractive. Inbuilt speaker also a good feature. But the visual content on the screen is discouraging me. Not interested to use much more. I want to sold it out. Very disappointed.

While there are a lot of cons, for this price it is hard to find another monitor that fits the bill.  EXTRA: Doe..."

So if u have connected it to tv etc, u have to everytime manually select audio input source."

4,"Honest review 1. Flipkart service great as always. Packing was okay (instead of wrapping in bubble wrap it was wrapped in small piece of carton due to which box got little damaged) but delivery time was excellent. Delivered in 2 days. 2. Router build quality is okay. As many customers already told about gloss finish easily gets scratched So, I won't get into that details and for me a router looks is not important, its functions are. 3. For those who don't know about 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz dual ban..."
1,"Hi Everyone,  So let's talk about D-Link 819 router. below all comments i personally experience that's way i am sharing with you all Flipkart buyer's and lovers üòÄ  1. D-Link 819 it's a dual band router 2.4 and 5 but the thing is for longer distances 5 gigahertz range not connected. 2.4 gigahertz range covered maximum 1.5bhk room not more than that.  2. As i buy this product for better performance and better experience of wifi range but D-Link 819 router not that much satisfied personally t..."
1,I don't know what people are liking about this product but to my experience what i can say is this product is just a piece of trash. Unusable. I have a 100 Mbps internet connection. And before this router i was using a TP Link singal band router. The signal of that router was so strong i could use that from the street ( I'm not kidding here). But due to some short-circuit the router got fried and i looked for a dual band router. And I got this. My experience with this router is horrible. I g...
4,"OK. I had searched for so many answers but didn't get it all answered even after going through all the reviews. Anyways bought this Dir819 unit in Aug 2019. I'll try to answer all questions I was looking for, maybe it'll hep others. Also I went for this model specifically since it had both 2.4Ghz (more penetration thru walls) and 5Ghz (higher speed) antennas 1) I primarily wanted this as a repeater to my main Keralavision broadband internet which was connected to a huawei wifi router (built i..."
3,"It is a very good router. The range is good for 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz have a low range but it is normal with 5 GHz. The only problem I found out is that if we are using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz at same time on different devices, the one with 5 GHz isn't fast enough i.e. the bandwidth distribution between both the bands doesn't seem equal. Otherwise it is a great product for its price."
5,"Since last 10 years I was using the net gear n150 which is my first router. As my fire stick was not giving good performance with net gear. I planned to go for this one as this is a dual band supports 5 GHz.  After connecting this beauty, I realised net gear has done its job & this is a beast of a router which is giving me a unparalleled & no loss connectivity at both 2.4 & 5 GHz range.  Just go for it. I love this product."
4,"A very good product for normal to heavy user. I use it for my smart tv and for playing pubg in my smartphone, it works awesome with my siti broadband."
2,"GENUINE REVIEW AFTER USING A MONTH...... >If you are buying this router considering dual bandwidth thn forget it and buy a cheaper one coz the range of 5ghz band is only 3 meters thats it. >If you have a 2bhk and you installed the router in hall thn 5ghz network will not reach master bedroom or any corner of house which is covered with many obstacles such as walls, almirah , washroom and so. >Only 2.4ghz band range will cover your whole house except the congested corners and washrooms. >O..."
2,"This Product seems not listed under the D-link India site . So can't see any firmware updates related files etc . More over , the Web ( internet ) LED always blinks ""GREEN"" whether internet is there or not . ( whereas I have TP-Link router , which shows Amber light when Internet is not available and same ED turn ""GREEN"" when internet is up. ) So it is very difficult to check the ""Net"" status by looking at LED light."
3,speed is good but range is not good as i expected over all it is good for that price
5,Very much satisfied with this project. The two types of bandwidth 2.4 & 5.0 GHz are additional advantage. But only 2.4 GHz is mostly used. Setting is very easy. Plug and play software is easy to operate and setting. Range is good enough across the 2 BHK home. Speed loss and packet loss is zero.
5,"Good product, easy installation, 5ghz range low, because its use for only High speed,2ghz speed good and range also be good. It has Repeater mode,that very nice... There are many more settings on the web GUI, ."
4,"Best Router at This Price, Satisfy With Both The Network; Pros: 2.4 and 5 Ghz Both Working Extremely Well... Go For This For Dual Band, Worth Product. Cons: Firmware is very weird, no global update and fixes... Even couldn't support bandwith limit."
3,The product is nice very lite feels cheap plastic and very fragile.the signal strength is very good and the speed its giving is also good but the setting not that easy you have do a lot of setting to properly setup like dns and security protocols of tkip and ies something took me time most of the router came with setting already but not this i got it for 995 so it is a steal a deal for me
5,Very good router. 2.4ghz range is better than tplink c60.5ghz working fine for my firestick.Overall very option at this price. I bought in 999
5,"Amazing router lovely working no disturb I am very very happy I use wi fi connection and brought many products from flipkart I love very much flipkart,s all product happy holly flipkart thank s slot"
5,"about the design - it is quiet good nice finish. speed - it's too good. work smooth, security settings is strong, you can mange and control the connecting speed and many more, just value for money"
5,Best wifi router in this price segment. Solid build quality. Great connectivity. No connection drops. 5Ghz speeds are great but range is low as expected with 5Ghz band. 2.4Ghz range is good. Prefect for a medium home.
5,For those who are using cable broadband this router is very good. The 5ghz band although has short range but blazing speed. If you are using 100mbps plan and still getting 5-6 mbps then its time to switch to this router to get full potential of your internet. I am having 80mbps plan with my age old router i was getting 6mbps max now i am getting 9.2mbps at all times. Pretty good router.
4,Aswm Router In this range..this Router in 2 options.. 5g Router.... Available in(2g/3g/4g) and best version is 5g.. Continue use cooling system. Good Router I am satisfied.. üòäüòä
1,"The only thing that was ok in this experience was the timely delivery. The product (D-Link DIR-819 750 Mbps Router) worked ok for just a week and after that, it stops working every 1-2 days. Every time it stops working, it has to factory reset to make it work again, but only to stop working after just a day.  It looks to me that the seller (RetailNet) has obtained some 2nd quality/refurbished pieces of this product is hence offering them at a discount from the market price. PLEASE DO NOT GET..."
5,outstanding product must buy it no drops in internet and the router range is very good when I reach out of my home I am getting signals 150 meters away from routers it has high gain antennas
5,"The setup was very easy and quick. Even the delivery was pretty quick, it got delivered within 12 hrs of placing the order. The range is pretty good. Definitely worth every penny spent on it."
5,"Highly recommended - I get the actual constant speed whatever internet plan I've. If you want speed upto 100 MBPS which is max for this router, without any doubt go and buy this one for amazing and long lasting experience. I purchased it 3 months ago and can't complain for any scenario because this is the best one. Also thanks to flipkart for their amazing service even flipkart is only one who cares about their customers by working on the feedback."
4,Nice one if you need a speed upto 100mbps otherwise go for a gigabit router if want 100mbps+ speeds.Overall the product is nice and works just fine.
5,Product is awesome and thankful for Flipkart helpful in covid19 time. Delivery Executive very much Polite and product get before date of delivery.
4,"Nice router with dual band. Sometimes I have trouble with 5GHz. It disconnects while gaming, not sure if it's a problem with my device or with the router. However it works pretty well even in noisy environments. ( We have 20-30 router signals in 2.4Ghz range near our house still works fine.)"
4,working perfectly good product and on time delivery by Flipkart..it works on both 2.5gh and 5gh covers good range
2,Works ok. With 3 antennas the range is still pathetic. Not worth buying instead go fo TPLink which servers better in terms of Wi-Fi range.
5,Im writing this after using of 3days.so as of now its working fine.good router with dual band in budget. And most important router range is good enough for private use.Im getting full signal with in 100 feet range.
3,"Range is not the best, it's decent compared to other routers, but when compared to Mi 4c router it doesn't stand a chance when it comes to range. Not only that, the mi 4c comes with a great app to control everything and a great interface too, but D-Link doesn't have any app and the interface is very generic. 5ghz band is great, really impressed with the extra speed I get out of the same network. On the 2.4 GHz the bandwidth goes upto 5MB/s at best, but on the 5GHz band it goes up to 8MB/s. th..."
4,"First off this was delivered within 2 days thanks to Flipkart, setup is quite easy, two seperate frequency, 5ghz is not good for my laptop or smart tv which are 5 meters away (no wall) from router with lags and buffering on 100mbps BB connection. Switched them to 2.5ghz and all is good. Now using my phone and tablet devices on 5ghz which is working fine without any buffering or lags."
5,thank you very very flipkart and dlink for this kind of product.........my service provider told me I got a decent product in low price......the range is very very good both 2.4ghz and 5ghz.........
1,It is fast enough when you stay near router. Range is not good. Very frequent disconnections. Cant get enough range in a bed room of 900 sft house when router is in hall.
5,The configuration is so easy less than 2 mints to configure. router was so good with very high speed internet from 5G band and a good range. Thanks Dlink for making an excellent product. Thanks Flipkart for making it available in our location and delivering the product with plastic free mission.‚ù§Ô∏è
4,"This is a fairly good router if you are just looking for very good 2.4GHz connectivity. Haven't faced any significant issues or connection drops over the last 9 months of usage. That said, this is a router that isn't perfect in many ways. It's a very old device that's modified for Indian market recently. The firmware update file can't be found in the mail D-Link site, but only in the Indian D-Link site. Also, a big drawback for me personally, was just 2 DDNS providers (dlinkddns,dyndns), o..."
3,"The router os good however giving 3 star because this doesnt come with manage via application, moreover Dlink official app doesnt support the model number Dir819, better to go for a router that dlink app supports, or MI routers since they comes with access via application.."
4,"Sharing this review after a one week use. Earlier I was using Dlink 600.   * Easy to configure * Dual band router within 1500Rs * 2.4 G will provide you enough single strength almost all corner of the house & 5 G will provide you good speed * Recommended for small house / office   I was not able to track my order delivery, which was the only issue.  However product got delivered."
4,Delivered timely. Its easy to setup. The range of 2.4 Ghz is quite good around 30 feet. While 5 Ghz range is not so quite good around 12-15 feet. Overall in this price range it's a good choice.
5,"This dual band router works like charm . The 5ghz has very good speed and also no problem while using 2.4ghz . After using asus RT-n12+ for 5+ years i think i have choosed the right product, it fits the right budget üëçüèªgo for it üòä"
5,The product is a very good choice for middle class homes....that is it is available at a affordable range. The quality of the product is very good....it gives a high speed and meets all my demands. Nice choice!
1,"Please make sure to check the internt port support speed as this router will only support speed upto 100mbps even if your internet speed is more than that. DLINK team, please do a better job in displaying the correct information for the customers so they choos3 the right product. Even if the router supports spped of 750mbps what is the use if the unput it takes only supports 100mbps. ????. This was waste of money as i came to know about this recently when i reached out to dlink via customer ..."
5,"Nice product with good range, my home is 1200sq ft, giving good signal strength anywhere in my home as wel as roof also, nicely working in my dell vostro 3400 and lenovo with win10 and win7 OS also."
4,Good dilevery time and as well as my experience it is good product and speed is too good..
4,I have just been using it for 2 weeks now so far no problem with the product. Overall it's has a good design and I pretty much like it So yea I will recommend this product to anyone who is interested in buying this product.
5,Good product in budget rate ...thanks hdfc bank for voucher ... Range is superb as my friend on lower floor enjoy wi-fi without any disturbance... value for money at this price.
5,"Very good product. The 5ghz connection covers very less area (for say just a area of 5m¬≤). But the 2.5ghz area covers a lot of area. It goes to the upper floor also. I'm using this product from the past few days, and I'm really happy with it. I use. Alliance broadband connection (network provider) with the product."
4,This is a very good router for a connection of 80mbps. It gives very good coverage in 2.4 ghz wifi and 5Ghz coverage is not so bad. It actually covers 3 rooms easily with 5 ghz and sometimes it may cover the full one floor of the house if the router is placed cleverly in the appropriate direction. The 2.4 ghz range is awesome and speed of 2.4 ghz is good too. I mean it will easily give you 70 Mbps in 2.4 ghz but the 5 ghz is overall very fast in terms of very high speed upto 100 Mbps. The rou...
5,Awesome product. Dual band running simaltenenously. Range of 5.0 GHz band is small but super fast and 2.4 GHz is as usual wide with good connectivity.
5,Best Router I Really Like It With His Performance ‚ù£Ô∏è And Thank You Flipkart For Fast Delivery In Lockdown. I Order Yesterday & Get Today üëç
5,This definitely does cover a lot of area than the single antenna options by dlink I've used before. Works awesome and a lot of cool features. Love the guest mode especially
5,Very good product under this price range... The coverage of the 2.4 and 5ghz bands are excellent and it provides good bandwidth... The build quality is awesome and overall its an excellent product..
5,Good product best router best range and fast network
4,Best for 1bhk. 2.4 ghz range is average. But device is good it's support dual band 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. 5ghz range is only for single room
4,Everything was good accept the packaging idk y this time they packd the good their self it was plainly packd like when u buy from a store. I have purchased menu time but this time I'm kinda disappointed. Other from that everything was good.
5,Genuine Review 1. Flipkart delivered the product before the estimate time. 2. In this price range this is the best router. 3. 2.4GHz has better frequency than 5GHz. But 5GHz speed is awesome. 4. Stable network from both band. In short its a truly satisfying router.
4,"For basic use it is the best choice üëåüëåüòâ Also if u want a great range ,for 2.4 GHz it gives fabulous range but for 5 GHz it give only 10 feet overall range in a spare... Still the quality and performance wise one of the finest ... If u want a good router in a value for money prize range ... It's one of the best choice... üíìüíìüíì"
4,Its a well built classy looking and obviously preety good working machine. Though its a older generation model and I am suggesting not to buy this product though it's price to performance is pretty good...
3,"Range is good (1st floor and 2nd floor) when router is kept outside the house, inside the house range is not good for 1st floor, deminsion of the house is 50x30 feet, net drops for mobile devices for fixed devices it works Ok"
5,Nice Router Bht 5GHz Range Is Too Low Even In Second Room It Shows Only 2 Bars Of Wifi
5,"Got it on the second day after placing the order. Thanks to Flipkart team for faster delivery. Now coming to the product review, I bought it for extending range of my JioFi. I don't have broadband connection, so I use the router as a repeater. So, it does works as a repeater. First, I tested in an open area. The speed test showed almost the same result conpared to my normal speed when tested as a repeater. Now about the range. I connected the router and placed it in a room. My PC is after 2 r..."
5,Very Good Works like a charm and great Band Separation
5,Happy with the product and it‚Äôs performance. Extremely easy to setup and handy for a home setup. Good customer service.
5,Best Dual band router in this price I buy at 999/- awesome range of both band the important thing is placement of router I placed in centre of my house(2500sqft) height of 9 ft it cover all my House . it surprise me when I got 2wifi signals in last room at 5ghz plan of internet is 60mbps of alliance broadband at 5ghz I got 65mbps and 50mbps at 2.4ghz
3,"Cost effective but with very limited Speeds and range.  This dual band router is available for offers from Rs 1200 onwards which enticed me into buying the same. The router was pretty easy to setup and installation did not prove to be a hassle.  But the range of the 5GHz and 2.4 GHz antennas leave a lot to be desired. In a two story house, you can pretty much ignore the 5GHz as the range is very limited, maybe to the room in which the router is kept. Even though the 2.4GHz range is available ..."
5,"Perfect and good design also Excellent in WiFi range but 5ghz is not as powerful like 2.5ghz, because 5ghz is not provide high range, but I like dlink 819 router. thank you Flipkart."
5,"Perfect dual bandrouter for my house. 5ghz has less range so it is used for my Android TV. No buffering of videos. 2.4ghz is used for other devices and has excellent coverage. Dlink Official App does not support this, only drawback. I am using this for last 2 weeks and no issues found till now...i will add further observation after couple of months. Till now device rocks."
5,Best router powered by D-Link. DIR-819 was dual band router one based on 2.4 GHz and another is 5 GHz . With have maximum capable speed of 750 Mbps. Build quality is best plastic body with glass finished. It work as both router and repeater. 2.4 GHz band range around 45-50 meter and 5GHz band around 35-40 meter that's very good.
5,Super router. You will see 2 SSID(If your mobile or laptop support 802.11a) in your mobile or laptop. One SSID is 2.5 GHz and another is 5 GHz. Connect 5 GHz to get full speed. Connect 2.5 GHz if your device is not supported to 5 GHz.  I am giving review after 4 months. I have not faced a single issue with it.  Thank you.
5,very nice product and has good range for wifi and including a higher range for wifi compatible tv's can cover up to 2 floors even of obstacle it's working great with tv
5,WiFi router range was very good . I love this product very much I think I hv get this product very good price also. I get very good price in deal . I get this projlduct in just 1000 rs only/- thank you Flipkart . thanks seller also.
5,"Yes. It's one of the best WiFi routers you can have. Obviously,it's DLink at the end of the day. Whatever broadband it is, it's easy to configure yourself and easy to access. no flicker in connections both GHZ work well . And provides the suitable and max speed taken up for you package."
5,works perfectly with my BSNL Fiber.I am getting 50mbps speed.Really happy with the performance.5ghz range is not up to the mark.However looking at the price what more you will expect.Overall good router.My suggestion just go for it.
5,Superb range and outstanding speed. It looks beautiful also. I am completely satisfied with it. Just go and buy it.
5,Awsome purchase. Range is not so good but still it's work for me. It will not cover a whole 3 storey house but it can easily cover a 1200sqft flat.
4,This router is good.It has good range on 2.4gz band but the 5 gz band range is not so great.The setup is very easy but sometimes the web page of d-link is crashing.After all it is a very good router in low price range.If someone have a high bugget then it is not for them.
5,"Nice product under 1000, works nice with JioFiber router as a range extender as well as a router. Range is good. Setup is easy. Product is 10/10."
5,Amazing speed with very good range. Fully Worth it. I just suggest everyone to purchase this router for good range and high speed.
5,great one I bought this router because of dual channel bands and worth it buying although 5ghz range is not that good as we know why but if it connected then it gives you privilege than other band
5,Absolute Wonder ! works like a charm üòª
4,Ease of use .....very easy to setup..but the wifi bandwidth is very short...only suitable for shot places like ...100 sqyard
4,I am very happy this modern very easy and fast
5,Owesome product Fast and reliable. Range of the WiFi is prety good it's door penitentiary so good and affordable
4,"router performance is good so far.. build quality is ok as per price brought it under Rs1200 ,duel band gives perfect range for small house ,very easy to setup"
4,Superb built in boat rockerzz really rocking and very nice in everything really satisfied and very much good but can get some more reduction on price then it will be fine but however very nice ?
4,"this is the the best Wi-Fi router I say this covers maximum distance gives better output, better if they provide any Wi-Fi software app to us so we can find out the usage and who are using that"
5,"using it in an 3 floor building, placed this in the central floor and it works great. stable connect is available in all the corner also"
5,"Highly recommended !! Range is very good, even I'm outside of my house still it's able to give full tower. Speed as same as my previous 2.4Ghz router of d'link. Lan connection speed is far better than the previous one. My computer is away from my router so, I use a 15m CAT 6 grade copper cable to use LAN connection. Now I'm using a 7.5MB/s or, you can say 60Mb/s Internet package has been provided by Alliance Broadband in LAN connection. I get minimum 7.1 MB/s or 57Mb/s in constant."
5,Nice product. Quality and packaging super..it's dual band router support 2.4 gh and 5 gh.. It's better to take dual band over single band of some extra pay. But delivery time from flipkart is very slow.
3,"The router is kept near the staircase on the ground floor. I get a good signal in the hall immediately above where the router is placed. However, the signal is weak in the ground floor hall, which is across the dining room and a small foyer. The TV in the hall would detect it, but not connect to it. Overall, its ok. Easy to setup and use. Both 5 Ghz and 2.4 ghz work and are easy to setup. (If setup correctly, when you look for networks on your device, you will find two router options on your ..."

Apart from that I'm very happy to see this product packiging and when iam open it woww the product was found good condition and the speed of the router was also superb I don't belive it but guys it's truth and u shuold for for this .. thanku u flipkart and whole team once again
4,Good router for the price. Definitely has more range than my older DIR 615. Config is super easy and comes with legendary Dlink DDS after sales support . Recommended
4,"cute good reception ,an back lit light to enhance tuning for elders could have been better"
5,awesome and best in budget as well as has good range
4,It is a very good product at this price. I use it for online multiplayer gaming as well and till now it works good. This does not have a modem inbuilt. If you want to connect to an ADSL / Telephone line you will have to either buy a separate modem or use another product.  Pros: 1. High speed wireless. 2. Dual band. 3. Does not heat up. 4. 3 antenna. 5. 4 LAN port. 6. 1 WAN port.  Cons: 1. Provided LAN cable is quite short.
5,Value for Money. Great product at this price. No network problems yet. Only setting up the router is a bit complicated. I suggest better watch a YouTube video a proceed. It also has a good range. Satisfied with the purchase.
4,"The router is good as it has dual band. wifi range is good than other router. one thing is very bad, the admin page which is not at all user friendly"
5,Product is good and wife range is good it support 5G and too fast nice easy to install and tqu to flipkart for nice product
5,Nice product. Coverage is good and wifi speed remains stable. It does not heat up a lot. Best value for money.
5,router is of decent built quality...Its a dual band router..both in 2.4 and 5ghz band u will get awesome speed..5ghz signal coverage is short..very less..This router is suitable for small home....
5,Awesome router within budget. I am using this router from last 6 months then writing my review. All time I connected to multiple devices like 4 mobiles and 2 laptops but no problem with wifi speed. Router range is very powerful. So I am really happy and satisfied with the product.
5,"Shaandar product nd offer, I got it only Rs900 from flipkart"
5,Best I classes
5,Excellent router! Amazing speed!
5,"good range, hi speed. thanks to flipkart+ekart for one day delivery üòò"

5,Very nice product ...
5,"Great product..... great delivery....Those who are thinking about a router in lower range, simply go for it..... Thank you Flipkart üòäüòä"
4,Product is good but delivery was too late.
4,Overall Good. But the setup configuration is bit confusing and there is no mobile application for this router to operate. That's the main drawback.
5,"Increased my JioFi M2 signal strength and coverage to a considerable level. about 70% better if not more. Tested with signal strength meter, it's woks great! The wired/wireless router can act as a router, repeater/extender/booster, creates strong wireless network with greater coverage area."
5,very nice...
5,fast delivery by flipkart.easy instalation.good speed.working good.
4,Not so bad
4,range of the router is quite good . Wi-Fi user interface he is acceptable at this price but the range of Wi-Fi is very good. you can install different OS in this Wi-Fi
5,Working fine and damn good speed. Very satisfied!!
5,just awesome product in this price range.. anyone can go for it undoubtedly.. üëçüëç
1,Had configuration issue while using every time i switch on the power button.will not recommend this product
1,Something wrong with router.Wifi gets disconnected automatically. Tried resetting but that also doesn't work. First time facing issue with Dlink. Even Not able to find this product on Official Dlink site for firmware upgrade.Similar product is there but not this Model.  Is this a real Dlink product?
5,Good Product easy to install and setup...Range is also good.
1,"This router is soo bad, everytime the electricity goes out I have to reset the router . And now I can't even return it !"
3,nice range .nice products. I am happy..
1,"not working properly,my service provider had said that product is not of good quality"
5,This is the product.
5,LOVELY PRODUCT ********** (10 STARS)
3,"Delivered on time , Installed and everything working fine as of now. I am getting almost 90Mbps speed for my ACT 100Mbps plan in 5Hz connection. Wifi coverage is normal. Not any issue with the connection yet. Sometimes 2.5GHz is more faster than 5GHz"
1,"I dont know if its only for my case. But after a month of use this router is not working properly. Internet is not accessible, alway shows no internet on both my laptop and mobile thought my ethernet connection is absolutely working fine. After turning on 5min and it stops giving internet access.. really bad experience with this product."
4,"after using 1 week signal strength is good, speed also good but 5Gz band signal not good, disconnecting every time"
4,This router delivered dual band Performance ‚Äì Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 433Mbps (5GHz) to deliver fast wireless speeds. Look very attractive & damn easy setup. I am getting signals throughout my house.
5,Best Router at this price...(rs-1099).. Range is good and the speed also very good. You should definitely go for it. Best value for money product.
1,After Seeing the Positive Review I purchased the Router But It Turnout a Nightmare. I Call My Technician To Installation Of Router But Due It's Hardware Issue it can't able to save changes of my ISP To the Dlink Router. He tried Very Hard But Due to Manufacturing Defective Piece He was Unable To Save Changes In The Router. My 1500 Rs Goes In Vain As The Flipkart Refuses To Replacement Of My Product. Never Purchase A DLink Router Of Any Model From Flipkart. They Cheat The Customer. GO For TP ...
5,Too much bad reviews regarding this router. It's true it has not that much range of like Mi 3c but more than enough for me.
5,Good product..
5,working as expected. great transmission speed and covers large area.
4,"rooter is good range, but gatting hot"
4,its quite vfm but lacks a app to control the settings which is offered by its competitors moreover 5ghz range is around 10 -14 m only but 2.4ghz range is crazy good upto 35 m pubg players will have to use the 5ghz always to avoid hing ping on the 2.4 one
4,"Both 2.5 and 5ghz are good, and nice simple network router."
5,awesome product
5,nice produt
5,"one more best product from dlink, very low price range in duel band (2.4 & 5 G) support"
5,Nice product üëå... I loving it...
5,The product is very good as per the cost price. Good quality product.
5,nice
3,"WiFi Range is very less ,if you move to other room then WiFi signal drops significantly other wise quality of the product is good. We can use both 2.5G and 5Gbands simultaneously."
1,its a fake dlink .. 5ghz range is tooo short and doesnt gives a proper speed . the model number dir819 is not mentioned in the official site also .. no dlink print on the router .. ..just a waste of time with money
5,Initially it had some firmware issue with fiber-net connection so i had to contact d-link and upgrade the firmware to latest whoever wants to buy this just make sure after the purchase you upgrade the firmware from d-link support staff only!!!!!! after the upgrade its really good i mean dual band at this price point is great ...just go for it and don't forget to upgrade the firmware!!!
1,"Coverage is extremely low, one should not buy this router."
1,"signal coverage is bad, wastage of money."
5,This is very useful product but range is too short.. otherwise is awsm..
1,Very Very Bad Quality guys do not Buy this Product worth of money
1,Worst.. everytime electricity goes off i have reset it.. and follow all the configuration procedure again.. this happens everytime electricity goes off or even switch off the power button.. what rubbish..
1,The devices resets often and the connection will be lost in middle of work.... and the frequency is very less which doesn‚Äôt accommodate a normal connectivity even in 30x40 size home with rooms
5,good product
4,good product at this price range. make sure your mobile phone Or Laptop supports 5ghz wifi else you can use only one band
5,"Atfirst I have received a faulty router. Problems are 1. No internet connection 2. Speed drop. 3. Cannot connect. Authentication error.  Faced may problems.  After that I visited service center, they have changed the board. And the scratched facial also replaced. Service is jst awesome.  Now. The router is superb. Like, 1. No speed drop. 2. Fast connect. 3. Tremendous range. Just superb experience from this router. My router is in the first floor and from the groud floor every phone has full ..."
1,Am using this product since 1 month and am facing lot of problems. This device is not supported 100 mbps speed and the speed varies from 3mbps to 80mbps. Internet is not at all stable. Am very disappointed with this product.üòïüëé
1,stopped working after 1 month
5,Good product. Almost covers all portions of the house
5,Ok
5,Love itüòçüòç
1,Router keeps restarting . don't buy
5,When i ordered this product i thought i did a mistake then i ordered mi router 4c and believe me mi router 4c is worst i returned it and now I'm happy with my D-Link router which is giving me 90-95 Mbps speeds in my 100mbps plan where as mi router was struggling to reach 50-60 Mbps Thanks flipkart lots of love
1,Dual band comes with single or same pwd for both 5 and 2.4 GHz . it will jump automatically.  for mine it is not even worked for 2 days. It showing Yellow exclamatory symbol. Always show no internet secured.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL FROM DLINK.  if you want Dual band please buy from another brand.
5,D-link router it's good brand....I'm satisfied
5,Perfect router for my needs. No issues.
5,"Writing after 1month use  Awesome router. But it's really difficult to setup. So much options are there and the manual has very less information. If you did not setup your router before, please call technician. Power adapter cable is really short (around 2 feet only).  Great strong signal (both 2.5 GHz and 5GHz). Worth of every penny. Just go for it."
5,It's very Good Products üëç
3,3 star is because the router is good but not up to the expectations.. I have got a 100mbps connection.. and with a 750 Mbps output router should perform at its best.. but I still find the network reach is little poor..
1,"Experience is to quality not good. Product break link in continues and need to restart every day 5 to six time and aslo router suddenly automatically shutdown. Facing Wifi signal hang and break. Range also to short whenever router dual band and triple antina 750 mbps.. So, finally suggest don't but this model.."
5,nice product.
2,not worth
5,"Range is good, Speed is awesome. Totally worthy!"
4,Good product
4,Good üòä
5,nice range and connectivity upto 60 meters
1,I was expecting a better range. I actually have to install the router in home in the very first room. The range is the problem here as there is no coverage after 3rd room. Bought this router because of range(already have Mi 3C router. MI router's range is better than this router). Waste of money. Also in gaming this router has some bugs. Sometimes not able to use voice chat while gaming. When I switched to other router the problem is not there.
5,Wonderful speed and Range... But configuration is not so easy for everyone...
5,it's better than mi router and its range over 40 meter at this price range it's the best router
5,Good
5,Wide Renge...Fast Forward..and
1,Not speed router
5,good super
1,Please do not buy this router. The speed claims here are false. This router is not capable of going above 100Mbps at all. I have a 150Mbps connection and have tried all possible configs to achieve the speed with no success.
5,the delivery boy was very nice and smart
1,"Not working Properly 5ghz band range is so poor,heating issue"
5,Best for 3 bhk
1,Pathetic WiFi router Always hangs and I have to reset Please don‚Äôt take this one
4,This modem is actually pretty good.
1,It disconnect with network a lot of time. I configured it about 3 to 4 time a day
1,"Not recommended, not a good product. Bought this router month ago. These are the issues with router I faced. 1. After a power outage, the router disconnects with Internet. we have to manually reboot both modem and router to get it restarted. 2. 5ghz network band range is very low. can't find 5ghz wifi at next room. 3. Corrupts video streaming from laptop to tv. Not sure if this is something which can be configured. 4. Web app interface often gives you error."
5,good range
1,Don't buy this ... Poor strength... Worst product ever purchased
2,Auto channel not support
1,This router stopped working after 1 month. Tried calling DLink CC but couldn't reach out.
5,Nice
5,Good
5,Best router for Office & home But Don't expect long range for 5Ghz band because any router has limited range with full speed for this 5Ghz band. Now coming to 2.4Ghz band ot has long range but less speed. This is the basic working of wiFi bands in any router. If wanted full speed WiFi network at your office and home go for it.  Note :- keep the router in the Hall or living room to get complete speed at your home. If you are using in office keep it in center of office to gain full speed...  ...
4,Problem in 5gz range. But over all value for money at this price range
5,great network and has boosted the speed of internet by around 4 to 5 times when compared to my last single antenna router. working great
5,Very good router must buy. I have 60Mbps alliance internet and router gives 60mbps both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. Maintain broadband speed correctly. All know what should be the range of 5ghz signal and it don't disappoint me. Any one whose budget 1600 they should try this. Until till now (6days uses) no problem has been faced.
5,PLEASE DO GO FOR IT. Was using a Tp Link single band router before & now with this one even my gaming issues are resolved via 5ghz & the signal range is Awesome on another level . With Tp link i was thinking i might have to use range extender on my ground floor but this one covers every corner of my house from top to ground floor even my friend's house beside me. I am using a Railwire broadband connection & never in 24 hrs my wifi or signal drops. #HIGHLY_RECOMMENDED.
1,It's a dual band but my 5ghz is not working
3,Product was fine. But ip address doesn't match when connecting to network.
3,Ok But not Good.
5,"Wifi router is so effective, this range is fabulous. Very good product,"
1,It's not working worst item I use only 10 day after that it's not working
3,Packing is not at all good.. It is visible to everyone
4,Average
2,"Very bad,signal loss problem"
1,Not working properly
1,Very bad item.not working with Hathway MNP network and cancel net.net connect also cut down in the middle time
3,This router is not that good as mentioned. It only offers 100mbps speed even though my connection is greater than that. Go for AC1200 if you manage the budget.
5,The product really good
4,Router is good but charger is Local class.. Damaged itself in 20days only
1,There is a connectivity issue when power goes on/off need to reset the router done the all configuration then it will be worked
2,Range of wifi is too much limited
5,Excellent product. Range about 120 meters. Speed is Very good ü§† üòäüòä value for money ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2,Poor speed not up to the mark
3,Well for low budget
1,Its worst product... Don't waste money...When power failure again configure required each time.
1,worst router available in the market today... latest firmware available to download.. able to save settings after trying for multiple times.. latency from router to desktop gets high even when I connected via LAN.. The router cannot be used in amplifier mode due to issues in the settings
3,"Admin panel UI is not user friendly. Changing any settings from admin panel is quite problematic, failed multiple times before saving. Not support WPA2 & WPA3 security, which is unacceptable nowadays. No updated firmware available. Speed and range is good for me."
1,Bad configuration setup.
5,Router is fantastic so satisfactions
4,Nice
5,Nice product
1,Stoped working after a month
1,"completely waste product, does not work, please do not buy this product. it's completely waste. they don't even take calls or reply to email. if they do not respond then they should close their rubbish company."
1,i am using this router for last 6 month.Wrost router had seen. SSID does not shown after power off on. its strange to use
1,It's not a user friendly
5,Probably the best router in this price range which has dual band connectivity.
1,does not work properly
1,Very bad quality.. Does not work properly.
4,If r u taking basic packs then u don't need this router. A normal 2.4ghz is enough for that
1,Never purchase anyone it work properly for just 1 week And now it's showing many problems
1,Due to made in China.... It's not Taiwan product
5,"Best router under 1500/-.  Tested Internet Speed over Wi-Fi: 120 Mbps  No heating issue at all... It can be left Powered On for month without any issue.  Best for 700-800 sqft area, single floor. Low coverage can be noticed on another floor."
5,Superb performance for that price segment
5,Range of 2.4 GHz bandwidth signal is excellent. Good choice for spreading a 100 Mbps connection across the home.
4,Unfortunately we dont have any good indian company to manufactur router else I had chosen any other indian company over chinese. This product is gOod but. It's chinese
1,This item has many problems for pppoe connection so i suggest you not purchase this item and flipkart show less price of this product then not be purchased this product
1,"Worst product it has issues with the connection, it keeps disconnecting from network"
1,Dont buy this... Connectivity problem is there... Go for tenda routers
1,Network connectivity is too bad
4,Nice. Very Lite Weight.
4,"This product is good Few points which i want to discuss 1. Wifi range of 5 ghz is 10-15 mtrs and 2.4 ghz is 20-25 mtrs 2. Bootup time is around 2-3 mins 3. Speed is upto the mark  [Note- my friends suggested me to buy TP-link c-20 but when i checked the specifications of both then i found that they are identical even price was same at that time, no difference so it's upto you which one you want to buy]"
5,At the price of 1299 it is beast...
5,Great one.
5,"Nice product ,working good, I am happy, thanks of flipcart for available this product. Naiknaware Bhaskar,Aurangabad Maharashtra."

1,Singal strength is very weak dont buy this product
1,I have Hathaway pppoe connection. Using this router my connection getting disconnect and not reconnecting back. Hathaway engineer told its a problem with Dlink's router any other router will work fine.
5,Very effective and nice product

1,"Waste router. Did a mistake not reading specifications before buying. This router has a 10/100 Mbps WLAN port. It can never support more than 100Mbps speed. Their claim of having a combined speed of 750 Mpbs is false. I updated my Internet connection of 150Mbps but this router won't go more than 100Mbps. Waste of money, return period is over now else would have returned."

Now changed my router and everything working fine ...
1,Very bad
5,Wonderful product ü§©ü§©ü§©Must go for it
1,Worst product the connection get terminated frequently. Even the service providers suggest this is the worst product.
1,1. Waste of money. Too many problems. 2. Internet gets disconnected again and again. 3. Settings are sometimes saved and sometimes not. 4. Of no use as i have to Reboot and Reset it many times to make it work. 3-4 internet disconnection daily. Go for TP link they r quite stable i hv heard. 5. No pc software to manage it.

2,High interference ......speed up down is high.......I wanted for refund but Flipkart is not giving.....written in the description that it gives high range but it does not....
4,Good one
1,SCAM ALERT!! SCAM!! This review is for those who will think this will transmit 300mbps through wifi. NO IT WON'T. If you have an internet connection with more than 100mbps and you want a router to increase range please don't but this. You'll get only 100mbps after the router even in ethernet and wifi. Its a scam. Please buy GIGABIT port router. This 750Mbps ad is a scam.

5,"Been using it for 4days now. The installation process was easy, just had to connect ISP for the IP/DNS address and you would be good to go with the installation process.  The range is pretty better than the DIR-219, which I have been using for the past 4years. Previously, the wifi would be around the house periphery but this router spreads the signal to upto around 15m radius around my house, though with lower strength as you go far from it.  Overall satisfied with the product. I expect this ..."

5,It's most valuable product . Value for money.
5,After One year of purchase the router is working fine. It gives expected speed of 120 MBps as per my internet connection and can handle multiple devices. I have used upto 20 devices and the speed didn't fell much.
5,"One of my friends suggested this router instead of Gigabyte which is bit expensive then this. But it gives me full satisfaction after installing this device. I am getting almost thrice the speed what I was getting before. Easy to install, range is also working fine at my premises for both 5gh and 2.5gh."
2,"It's not working as mentioned ...it always losse the connection and tells u wifi has no acces to internet. This type issues are also with other wifi but your connection will come back in 2 or 3 min but in this case , it wil take months or may be a year untill you replug the wires and connect it again... Totally waste"
5,Nice but I am use also late
3,If you gonna use 5ghz from different floor of your house.....then u might face speed drop. So use 5ghz wifi option only when u r on same floor at which router is installed.
5,Good
5,Nice

5,Good Product
5,As my Internet pack is of 30 Mbps. This Router has given me a speed of 29-30Mbps (For 2.4Ghz) and 78Mbps Downloading speed (in 5Ghz).
5,Ok
3,The first one that I recieved was a defected one and it took me nearly a week to get it replaced after n number of calls. But the product is good and recommendable. Don't buy if you have an urgency because by chance you find a defect these people will literally test your patience to the core.

4,Good coverage area for 1BHK & 2nd will also get good network but speed will be low
5,Good

4,"I am writing this after using it for 7 days, range is pretty good, 5ghz band is pretty stable(many router have stability issue in the 5ghz band). 2.4 ghz best for long range coverage, ventilation is pretty good. Let's see if it holds up in the long run, i heard dlink is not good in it's firmware support, gonna test that out and update it here."

4,Awesome product
1,Not up to the mark Only supports 4 devices before latency drops over WiFi (counting all the devices connected to it on both bands wirelessly) Been using it by lan for gaming due to latency drops Glitchy UI and have to reload the same page multiple times to confirm a command The schedule feature does not work on Mac address filter (hopefully will be sorted in updates) You cannot assign specific speed to specific Mac addresses the main purpose I bought it for. 5ghz is a scam this bandwidth is...

5,Great Product. A must buy for each and every purpose. Highly satisfied with it
5,"this is the cheapest dual-band WiFi that I could found. the set-up process is very simple and this is a very fast router. If you have devices that support a 5GHz band this is a very good investment. There is venting on the router to manage heat and when used extensively this could heat up. the build quality is good, but the power adaptor is cheap looking. Please note that is not a modem but a WiFi router."

5,I used it 1 month. Good product. Tnkz you flipcurt.
3,I have been using the d link 600m router for the past 2 years. Due to its limited range I have updated to 819 router. But able to get the same range with this router also. Not a big difference with the range. Very dissapointed.

4,Best
2,Automatic Reset
5,Nice
5,"Excellent product. Setup was easy. Been using it from past 2 months and have not faced a single issue be it range or consistence. D-Link (Taiwanese company) is much better than tp-link, tenda and other chinese routers which fail within few months of purchase (had a bad experience with my earlier tp-link purchased offline). Router pairs perfectly with Cuzor CZ-01A-12 for power backup in case of power outage."
5,Nice product
5,Good
5,"amazing product, the quality of the product is perfect , service provided by flipkart is excellent. It also has warranty of 3 years and you can also get servicing of your product if the product is in warranty period. thank you flipkart"
4,"After using 1 month 27 days- now it is very bad, the router is creating more issue to connect the modem, after restaring it 4-5 times, then it connect with modem. When you switch off the power and switch on the power again, then it will not conet with modem.  If any one can help me ,please let me know. I suggest don't buy this device.  I talked to customer care and he helped me to configure the router now I m feeling this is good.  Please buy this and ask for configuration from customer."

5,Very good product in best price Personaly recommend buy this product
1,absolute trash worked just 1 year with a lot of issues its really sad to see Dlink having such a bad performance
5,This is the best i have used till yet. I have 75mbps plan and on 2.4ghz i get 70mbps download and upload and on 5ghz i get 76 to 80mbps download... Value for miney.. Must buy this
4,"The router works well. The 5G channel works only in Line of Sight devices. 2.4G has a wider range but mostly range is limited. Although full signal may show as available in wider range, it only works best in a 800 sq.ft surrounding. Hence the 4 star rating."

There is no app to it to change settings or to know how much data we consumed or to know how many devices are connected. They will provide you a website where you can change settings but website is not at all good. You need to refresh everytime you change the setting. When compared to this, MI router is best to manage the router easily but dlink provides you 3 years warranty and we know dlink ..."

Power light start blinking anytime and the router goes offline, it goes out of range for all the wireless and wired devices. 2. Wi-Fi range is very poor...geeting poor range in 5+ meter distance with 5Ghz connection. 3. No Firmware update, the current firmware is also faulty, not showing the status and sessions information.  Basically its a very poor product both Hardware and Software."

5,"Very good router if yoir internet connection is upto 100Mbps, just make sure the router configuration/setup is done properly.  Note: This will not support internet speeds higher than 100Mbps. For 200Mbps - 1Gbps connections better to go for a Gigabit router."
4,Nice one
3,"It's too light weight, doesn't give feel of durable, Everything is ok but range is very low, 5Ghz range is 4,5 m only, and 2.4Ghz range is not so good as others routers"

4,"Good product, specific speed achieved with dual band."
1,"I return this product but they denied they are not excepted and they replace tjis product but are not refund the money only relplacement facility are there it is a bad thing because i like this product but my laptop are not supported this tyoe of ports and in my area ethernet wire are not available in this area that,'s why i return this product and i buy some other product but they refuse ...

1,The worst wifi router i had ever seen... the range is very low ... its range is similar to tenda 301 whose price is just 600 or 700... sometimes the router restarts itself... so if u r looking for a router which is good in range then dont buy this one..

3,Only a router does not have inbuilt modem or DSL port
4,I am happy.. buy this product
1,Writing this review after using this router for a year now. This router gets disconnected every now and then. Very bad signal range and speed.
4,Resolved my problem ....working perfect with good coverage . .
3,"Better go for TP link in dlink no app to monitor  not easy to configure,  sometimes wifi does not work and then you have just plug an LAN to laptop then it will work"
5,Great product delivered on time.
4,Nice in this price band
5,Nice... Good sirf and coverage
5,excellent
2,Frequency is not up to the mark
4,very good
2,"Disconnecting frequently, I should have gone through the reviews thoroughly :( Believe me and go for other router!"
5,As A Expected Speed Gives Fast 5G It's Cover My Whole Bunglow Wireless Network Internet Speed around 1950Sqft....
3,Good
5,Nice product
5,Good product at this price range
5,Very good product. Definitly go for it. And I got a very fast delivery #3 days earlier than the listed date. And this router cover a very good range.
1,Worst product
2,It does provide good speed in the same room but it does not have good coverage. Coverage of my single band dual antenna router is much better than this. I will not recommend it as it doesn't have enough coverage.
5,Totally satisfied with this Router. Works perfectly as expected. No connection issue. Really useful dual band wifi. Go for it.
5,"Issue some time of reconnecting.. but overall the product is great for signal strength and it had modes low,medium and high you can choose it. you can use this as a extender alo.. overall product is good.."
4,"It's a really awesome one. We can buy for a small house, fixed at hall in my 1bhk 5GHz been covering my entire Home. 5Ghz range is little disappointment. Where speed is as expected per my allocated Bandwidth. Yes no hesitation in buying it, purely 4* for the performance and little disappointment with the 5G Hz range."
1,No support of this legacy device. Dont buy it. if you just want to use as normal router for <10 Mbps connection then fine. Else it is complete waste of money. you cannot use it as a proper repeater(or range extender) if you want to couple if with another router to extend the range.
3,It's range is not that much good...
1,"It only works 1 band, 5Ghz band is not working, it disconnects automatically."
1,We are having an issue with the software
5,"5 GHz is connecting only to laptops and PCs, that too high data transfer can be seen in vicinity of router. Whereas 2.5 GHz one connect is in the whole house."
3,Nice looking.
4,Offers good coverage and connectivity options also is also pretty apt in this price
3,Good
1,5ghz not working üòï
4,The device fulfilled my needs. But the piece I received was manufactured in 2016. So out of the box the firmware used is old. Felt bad. During holiday sales companies just cheat and you realise the problem only after use.
3,Ok
4,Nice
5,Great option for home use
1,Automatically disconnects. No internet issues. Worst Router. Go for the TP LINK or Netgear instead.
5,It is working fine

4,Good quality
2,No range and cheap quality when i ask to return it flipkart is not accepting my request fail product!
5,Good luck
5,Excellent
1,"Range matching with 2 antenna not 3. 3rd antenna doesn't seems to improve range, otherwise working good"
2,"It is not 750 mbps, its max speed is only 100 mbps, why you have written 750mbps??"
5,Superb and excellent Working I use this router for bridge connection from my fiber router
3,Expectations not reached
5,It's good not too bad. I will suggest to go with the new models.
5,Nice
1,Worst. Often getting reset
5,Nice products in 1300

4,Working fine. 5hz range is quite low. Rest is ok
5,Best dual band router at this price range.
3,"Range is very poor. The 5Ghz signal is not reachable beyond 2m.2.4Ghz too has poor range though much better than the 5Ghz one(7-8m).Regarding the speeds,I get 90Mbps for a 100 Mbps connection for 5ghz while 70mbps in 2.4 ghZ. Disappointed"

5,Realy osum... Product best signle range.. üòçüòçüòçüòò
1,"Range very good but connectivity is very low, connection are be broken"
4,Really good router but you need a little bit of knowledge about configuration before set it up. Otherwise it's a really good device. The only problem I felt is there is a slight gap of signal with router and beta converter. If you are ok with it then cheer's.
1,Worest Quality
3,Good price
1,There is no either net cable in the box Very worst delivery
5,It is good and covering 900 squremeter flat im each room easily and better speed..

5,Very good router for home and home office. Please go for it if you 're nit heavy user.
5,"Got at 1139 , best price ... No need to think. Get. It does worth your penny."
5,Ok
3,Not bad

4,The product is ok
5,Good one..ordered 2nd time for nephew

1,A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE THIS TIME I HAD WITH THIS PRODUCT. A TOTALLY WORST PRODUCT WILL BE THE SUITABLE NAME FOR THIS ROUTER. I CHANGED THIS ROUTER TWO TYPES AND BOTH THE TIMES THE ROUTER WAS CORRUPTED FROM ITS SOFTWARE.

1,My router is not work properly and run any system please return my product
5,Nice product
5,Good Rage.
1,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
5,I'm happy with this product. It's really good product and I think I have purchased over a perfect product. Range of the signal is enough for me and it gives me superb signal whether I am in the room or I am in another floor.
5,"Recommend it as this is a great router with a good range and can handle multiple devices with ease. It's been 4 months and I am completely satisfied with its performance. And as a cherry on top, it has a very user-friendly app to monitor its access and other settings."
4,"For the price this is a decently good router with single band four antina router. I have a 60mbps lan connection and its works great , also the range is also very good. Using its about a month now its good ‚úåÔ∏è"
4,"it's range is much less compared to mi 3c positives 1. latest features according to latest developments in wireless technology. 2. it has 3 modes wireless LAN , wireless repeater and access point , since this is my second router in the house and I am not a fan of repeater i am using in access point mode. 3. Good design aesthetic wise. negatives 1.No 5ghz AC mode support however at this price only iBall provides it. 2. Range is a big issue 3 antennas seems to be for show purpose mi 3c gives ..."
3,The range is good but the problem is speed decreased when i compare with my dlink single antenna router and ping is also too high like 80-120 so for mobile and pc gaming iwont prefer it . Add some money and buy good one
5,Great nice products...it has good range with 3 antenna... compared to market price..I got 970/-....it's good deal.... thanks Flipkart..
5,"Initial impression is great. I don't know why people is complaining about range. This thing got exceptional wifi range, the signal is also super stable. Just place it somewhere high also keep away from walls and metals. App is just for the name, only basic stuffs in app. Wifi recieving and transmission power is very good. 5 stars for it. Let's see how well it goes. Will definitely update in future if anything goes wrong. Packing was below avarage, came in its own carton. No proper packing was..."
5,First of all it got dillivered very soon even before the time and how it was shown in the image it was actually like that in real overall a nice product even in this Price...... absolutely happy with the performance and you should definitely buy it üëåüèªüëçüèª
4,in 900 its a good router to buy. gives good range and the durability is also good and build quality is good.
5,"very good wifi. I'm using this one as a range extender and is working fine for me.  you can easily connect it with your existing wifi router and place it within range of the existing wifi. You just need to follow the steps as per manual for installing as a range extender.  Very happy with the product, mostly with the range extender mode."
1,Not great product at all. My single antina router is doing better or almost the same. Expected better range .
5,"AMAZING PRODUCT RANGE IS QUITE GOOD AND THE PRICE IS ALSO LOW IF YOU GO TO MARKET FOR BUYING THIS IT WILL COST MORE THAN 3000 RUPPES ....... ABOUT THE SPECIFICATION :-  TOTALLY IT HAS 5 ETHERNET CABLE PORT  IN THE BOX IT HAS THE ROUTER,RJ45  IT HAS THREE ANTEENA.  IF YOU WANT ONLINE GAMING AT AT A LOW COST IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.  IT IS BETTER AT HD STREEMING  OVER ALL GOOD PRODUCT AT A LOW PRICE.  MUST BUY......."
4,Well the product is still working well... It's been almost a month since I have purchased it... So recommended for people wanting to buy a new router... Great purchase üòáüíôüíô
5,"very beautiful, very good user-friendly interface, and better build quality. Has no cons. It is a pro wifi router in this price range"
3,Good basic router with easy to configure function and mobile app to manage it.  However don't get too impressed looking at 3 antennas in my option they are not serving the purpose.  The range is only slightly better compared to my 6 year old router.  I started using router after a week of delivery and hardly got time to check the range and strength and hence return period was over or I've would have returned the router.
3,"It is a good product, very good capturing capacity , nice range overall very Good product."
5,Best router in the price. Good Range and wireless internet speed is coming good than my previous router. The another best thing is the mobile app which have good user interface and functionality.  You can also set up a guest login without sharing the guests the actual passwords. There is also a IPTV mode. I will look into it.  There are also different setup options. ‚ù§ Loved the product ‚ù§
5,The speed is good and the connection is strong & reliable as well as it's easy to configure. It's lightweight and looks great. The TP link app also has a lot of features.
3,"three stars are because it performs well without any hardware issue. Renowed brandings. surely you can buy this, but if good range is your concern they you should find other option. i stay in slums horizontal distribution of range is good enough but vertically its weak. there are little variation in speed. my final verdict is at this budget superb deal"
5,Great router....awesome range...for 899‚Çπ its more than value for money.
5,It works well.
5,best n router in that price i was satisfied by the tp link

5,"Amazing quality router at this price. Loved it ‚ù§.The tp-link app gives a more user friendly interface. U can change ur connections, passwords, Network name with just a tap.Also comes with a guest feature that prevents ur naughty cousins from overconsumption of ur internet üòÇüòÇ"

5,Very good working.üëçüèª
5,Too good
5,Frst wanted to go for Tplink_Wr840n but after a detailed study chose this. REASON-has 3 antennas which provide a better transmission then 2 antennas. And in the future can also go for wired connection. No use of buying small devices for extending range that tplink provides just for looks. I have 30 mbps jio fiber connection and haven't been facing any issues with alrdy 6+ devices connected. Looks quite pretty in that white colour. Just loving it.
2,"Routres are supposed to last for years, this one just died in 3, immediately after warranty ended"
5,good more reliable fast and good speed nice n router thank u flipkart.....amazing
5,Good üòò
5,Ok
5,"Good router. Looks sleek and range is pretty decent too. My apartment is over 1200 sq ft. The router is setup in one corner of the house and I receive decent signal at its diagonal opposite end, with 2 walls standing in between. The speed does get a little affected but it's ever so slightly. Nothing major. Good router for home use."
5,Nice product build quality is so good Network of wifi is every where in the house.
2,Worst product.. the radius is not even covering 20metre
5,Nice product
3,I thik it is ok but if you need a range wifi router it is not a very good range router so you can buy another one
1,Worst product I have ever seen it automatically disappeared network issue and I'm having internet connection of 150mbps and this router gives me around 30-40mbps maximum and I'm using it by LAN cable then also I'm having this issue. Please think twice before you buy this product.
5,very nice and best price
5,This is very good and nice speed every one should try
1,"It stops working in between, don't show the range, slow internet speed all this I am saying after using it for 1month."
1,Get disconnected
3,TP-LINK ROUTER WORKING BEST BUT SOME ISSUES IN ROUTER. WORKING TIME AUTOMATICALLY SHUTDOWN THE ROUTER. THEN AUTOMATICALLY ON.

3,"has a connectivity issue, connection is lost or getting slow sometimes while working. when there is no connection still the internet indicator is showing ""green"" which should not be. better go for TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300Mbps Wireless N Router (White, Single Band) as 'old is gold'. only plus point is ""better coverage"". **** please plug out the adapter & cat-5/fiber optical cable during thunderstorm/cloudy environment. warranty issues/product service is good."

Hence, I didn't have much knowledge about this sector. Had to rely totally on Reviews and YouTube Videos. Couldn't find much choice in this range, and I wasn't willing to pay a penny more than 1,300! Well, I don't regret buying this router. Serves its purpose perfectly. I came across with some reviews stating its poor bandwidth. But I'm surprised, ..."

5,this is very good
5,This is awesome it has great range also connect to tether app which makes it more easy to acess
5,Awesome product. All the antennae working perfectly. I placed the router in my first floor drawing room but I am receiving signal even in my ground floor and my second floor rooms. Totally worth it. So if you are looking for a router with greater coverage area then go for this one.
4,Delivery of flipkart is good. Packing of this product is slightly disapointed. Product quality is fine. But the rang of this router not like 3 antena. Waves of antena cant cross 3 walls beside. The female jacks of this router get some loose with male jack. But the coverage of a 3 floore building is very good. Speed also good. Thank you flipkart for this low price(999).

No any faltu apps clean experience. 18 w fast charging is good and quick charge my pad. Display quality very good fhd display. I think this pad 2021 best budget segment pad for Indian market. Better than Samsung Galaxy A7 Rank:- Camera 5/3.5* Display 5/4* ...
4,Totally satisfied with the product. At this price range(13999) I could not expect any better than this. If you are wanting to buy a tablet then blindly go for realme pad. Best at the market at this price range.
5,Really very awesome... Love it üòçüòçü•∞ Happy to buy it üòç Everything is perfect but Camera üì∑ .. ..
5,"First impression - awesome. Very slim, sturdy metal finish, good sound output with 4 speakers. Display is good enough and quite reaponsive. Did not experince any lag. Camera is reasonable at this price. Final Verdict after some usage."
5,"Got this Realme Pad wifi only variant at Rs.12k. I think this is the best Tablet ever built in India. I'm fully satisfied. Viewing angles are great. Brightness is very good, never felt low. The best thing is the quad speaker. Best. Used for 1 week.  I got my first delivered Realme Pad wifi only replaced as i saw there was a small bright white dot in the display. Flipkart delivered the replacement next day. This unit has no issue so far."
4,Ordered grey tablet but received gold colour. behind the cover it clearly says gold colour .already took 7 days to reach me.so I didn't return it.bad service from the seller.. about the tablet realme pad is a great value for money product.good looking tab.performance is good. iam not a gamer.i bought this for media consumption mainly.for that reason this is a terrific purchase.
5,"In price range is better than author tab. Best display, good battery life, WiFi+ 4g , and easy to use. Thank you REALME."
5,NOTE:-They should need to protect display by screen film as they provide in phones display for avoid immediate use of Tempared glass i have seen this issue i m little worry about display coz of no protection apply and i have no tempered glass otherwise good product and fast delivery  1-Good product by realme 2-Display is awesome 3-Sound is great dolby atoms did it absolutely fine 4-Battery also nice
5,It's really nice tablet compare to other option available in market... Just order it without hesitate. I m happy with this product... Thanks flipkart and realme.
5,Nice products and delivery boy has a good nature ........ timely deliver the product and caring for your order ....... thank you Flipkart
4,"Got it in offer for 13.5 K so worth it. Excellent sound quality due Dolby system. Display is also good but not great. Camera is average, don't expect quality pictures out of it. Design is very good, metal body. Can't talk about performance as I didn't use it much. Overall this is a great Tab compare to other brands, I liked it. Very good for Children."
5,Amazing product in the budget range. Sound effect is too good. Usually wi fi I will be weak in tablets. Realme pad has an excellent Wi-Fi range. Full battery last for around 6 hours. It takes 2 hours and 40 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%. A very nice product.
5,"Special Thank Flipkart for helping me , always trusting your services ( way you replace my problem with happiness)  Thanks realme for lower price best tablet in market"
5,Writing my review after a week of usage.  It's one of best Android Tablet in the price segment. Just go for it.  1. Decent front and back camera and perfect for zoom and ms teams meetings. 2. Stock Android and no unnecessary apps. 3. Hybrid slot which has Expandable memory slot and another nano SIM card on which you can place call using 2G/3G/4g 4. Excellent Display with good viewing angles and brightness. Great experience on OTT apps. 5. Nice surround sound with 4 stereo speakers and dolby a...
5,"I loved it it's pretty good,camera also pretty good u can expect decent pics it won't disappoint you,sound quality is extraordinary,enhance extra boost in setting for more sound and bass in sound section in settings.performance is also pretty good, screen is lovable and good size.brighness is descent as per it's screen, video calls or meeting gonna be fantastic,it's my genuine review after using two days,I gonna update review if I face any issue thank you üòäü§ù"
5,"I've been using it for last 10 days, amazing sound, decent display and great performance. Overall, a great buy at 14k for 4/64."
3,With a lot of expectations I just bought this realme pad instead of buying Samsung and Lenovo. Screen resolution battery Camera all are good. but while coming to some of the applications and games it was showing slowness in the system even though I bought 4GB ram 64GB rear pad. The very big minus is still I haven't will get the exact screen guard and flip cover I just searched in many sites. If you just want a tablet for watching movies and online classes it's a good choice but for gaming ...
5,"Nice real me pad, good looking.,,, dolby digital sound very clear must buy it. Thnks flipcart . Camera 8 mega pixel is very clear and vivid. I got as I exepected."
4,"One of th best mid range Tablet from Realme as per features and power packed performances .. Best thing is full metal body which looks amazing and "" U Beauty looks "" .. Connectivity is just too good but a slight con is Display which cud have been better with Amoled or FHD kinda' .. Overall display is fine but slight problem is bigger screen size which at times "" incase tab falls cud harm th screen "" otherwise it's a too goody Tab from Realme.. Decent performances with super üîã backup tht runs..."
5,"I purchased it for minor Microsoft excel work and video streaming, for both, this device works smooth. battery last for 3 days and speakers are crisp. Display is good, built quality is premium, especially when used without a case or cover. I have asked Realme to bring Samsung Dex like feature, if they listen and roll out that through an update, this tab is the perfect one you can own."
4,The delivery service was good it came 2 days early. N camera is good battery backup is good you can it use all day once greeting fully charged. Sound is awesome. Display is smooth. Light weight in compare to others.. justify the price. The one thing which I didn't like is it took too much time to charge around 3:30 hours.. but infront of its qualities you can neglect this problem.. I recommend you to buy this this is worth your money seriously
5,It is smooth and looks good. Feels like a premium product. Battery backup is good. Display is the best feature on this tab. Worth purchasing. Should wait for a longterm usage review!!!
3,UI is not that much good Display is not that great NO fast charging video quality is average it is a DUAL SIM supported tab but if u put two sims NO chance for SD CARD the biggest Part I don't like is unlike other tablets it has no inner speaker to attend calls you have to attend calls on LOUD SPEAKER ONLY  Total review is its just an AVERAGE tablet.. go for lenovo M10 Fhd plus
5,Best at this Price Point.. No other Tablet comes in this range which has these kind of features and design.. The best part is the aluminum unibody design.. Display is just awesome. Battery Backup is descent. Overall a great pakage with low price point.. Best for students
4,Overall Good Tablet under affordable price range. Pros - All Good especially the speakers are amazing ! Cons - Auto Brightness isn't that great. It'll always reduce the brightness very low.

5,"Exactly what I expected in this range. For work purposes, anyone can buy. At about 14k, absolute steal. No lags yet. Of the 4 speakers, 1 felt damaged after 2 days, but somehow a restart fixed it. Battery lasts several days for me. I haven't used Samsung tab, or Lenovo tab so can't compare. But Samsung device's short life span, and Lenovo's lack of support won't ever let me recommend them!"

5,A wow product
3,Over all the Tab looks quite premium. The performance of the speakers is quite loud but lacks clarity. Though the Dolby atmos effect is inferior to Samsung A7 on the similar segment. The display is good but not as bright and clear as Samsung. Basically it is because of the contrast ratio which is poor in comparison. The user interface is bad with No frills. You can't even change the theme of the desktop. You can only change wallpapers and that too which are preloaded. There are many small th...

4,"For the price it has got very decent specs. Screen and speakers are definitely its strong zone. Performance is ok. G80 is powerful enough to do all basic tasks.  However the only downside of the product is its software. Os needs some major updates, because its just as important as hardware. Hopefully realme will provide them soon."

Audio through the speakers is amazing, coupled with its nice display makes it good option for all sort of media consumption . Performance is decent for the price Built and in-hand feel is also above average. A slightly more powerful SoC would have made a no brainer option for everyone. Still i would recommend this for everyone who is not a hardcore gamer."

It doesn't look like 8mp Made in china No screen protector inside the box. You have to spend extra 300 for a low class screen protector

5,"One of the best Tab in this price range, Display is also good, battery is also good. But the processor is ok in this price range. Lots of features are available, and you can do any work with the help of S Pen, S pen is also working vey fine. I love this tab."
5,Design and finish is as expected from the pictures. Colour is same as shown and very appealing. Samsung has done a very sober work. Performance wise its great and battery backup is too good but charging takes a bit longer coz of the massive 7k mah battery. Screen is vibrant.  Cameras are average and good for video calling stuff. It runs smoothly. Stylus works just fine. You can go for Huwavei mediapad 5 lite at 10k lower price but its Chinese. Samsung hardware is more trusted than Huwavei. It...
4,"For 32K, this is probably the best tablet you can get. I'm a student so note taking is a regular activity for me, and in this regard, this tablet is absolutely incredible. The included S Pen is amazing and the tablet acts as a great notepad to take notes. For media consumption, the display is good enough, the colours are good and brightness is sufficient but it's clearly lacking the punchy colours of an AMOLED display. Speakers are plenty loud. Battery lasts all day, sometimes 2 days dependin..."
5,"In this budget, I honestly think that this tab has it all that a student requires. Pros:- 1. A really huge battery which gives you a really long battery backup. 2. S pen, which works pretty well with variety of functions. 3. Premium look of the tab, Sleek design, matte colour body, and two powerful clear sound speakers on both sides of the tablet which give you premium sound experience.  Cons:- 1. Although the tab supports fast charging, they give you an ordinary charger. No turbo charger add..."
4,This is over all good but price is higher you may compare to apple and choose this over for s pen ..i did that too .. battery capacity was good 7040mah but it takes time like 3.30mins for full charge 1hr 30mins for 30% charge . S pens lag sometime . If you're just looking for a good storage and zoom meeting and s pen then go for this otherwise go for something else . Im using this for 3 days its good thou but price is higher
5,"Best tab for note making and best for reading and onenote works pretty good in this tab, with the reliability of samsung"
4,"Very nice and useful for students, if used with proper apps and tools, Just download all your books and need not to carry heavy Bags of books wherever you go. Students visiting hometowns will be very happy when you take ur notes and books wherever you go in just few grams of weight."
5,"Have nothing to say much about an android tablet which is in the top 3 ranks in the world I would say... If you have this budget and it's worthy to go for it instead of Apple's 8th gen ... SPen gives the different experience... Sound quality is very nice... No complaints about the Exynos processor... Also use the Samsungs Buds+ offer with this tab's imei... it's really worthy considering all the offers (instant discount, Buds+, S Pen)"
5,"Excellent product, working fine since last 3 months. Stylus works fine. Good for graphics on the move. Good battery backup. Good display and memory for medium level graphic apps. Bit upset with Samsung for not honoring offer of earbud."
4,"Best tablet for kids in budget , there no Qled display but It's tft led pannel doing great work instead, front camera is good enough for online meeting back camera not good enough but no need to use internal memory is only 64 gm but no worries it's come with expandable memory slot it's good thing than iPad , memory only 4 gb not enough i think , it's slower for heavy application , but good enough for kids use , sounds are too good and Dolby digital supported clear and loud , s pen is too smoo..."
5,"Got it for 23K INR. So far good. If you are planning to buy, then carefull while buying the cover as many of the cases dont have proper slots to place S-Pen. Magnetic attachment is a temporary solution to keep S-Pen while using. So buy a cover with proper S-Pen slot. Avoid covers where a slot is provided at back side of tab as they cause many troubles. Look for a cover with side S-Pen slot."
5,"It's a cool tablet. Good display, great sound and battery... Good for students."
4,"Best Tablet in this range with these specifications. I have gone to this tablet because my budget was just 30K and I was getting I pad 8 32 Gb for this and for me brand is never a constraint. Display is good. Touch sensitivity is also good. S pen works brilliantly. This gives call feature too which apple ipad does not give. I have just one con till now: The charging time is very high. If samsung would have provided fast charging facility with this, then it would be a beast in this range. It t..."

5,"I brought it about a 2-3 weeks ago, so I'm writing this review according to this usage. For this price range with a Spen is an absolutely amazing purchase option as student. I write all my notes in this tab, there is no lag, good display, lot options available. Only one thing i will want to point out is the battery charging time, it takes up a long time to get 100% charged. So if you are a student like me, i would say go for itüëç"
4,Best for the price you can get and the delivery is fast and s pen is not sharp as other Samsung devices
5,Camera quality is good but i am giving 4 stars because its just of 5mp and rear is of 8mp thats good but not enough good to take sceneries but for video conferencing its very good and there were some issues with touch but they got resolved and the battery life is of 7040 mah but i had to use zoom app for my online classes and it consumes a lot of battery over all the performance is good
4,"The Samsung s6lite tab is the only tab available in this prize range with good camera and functionality. S pen has added advantage. Display: supports and play 4k videos smoothly. It's non-amoled and therefore colour and contrast appears dull particularly in photos. Battery: can last for 2-4 days in full charge, though charging takes long time (5-6 hours). No fast charger and short cable. Camera: back camera is better, but front is OK and good enough for Online meetings. Better than most tabs...."
5,"Amazing product Was thinking of buying something else as this tab is almost a year old, but couldn't find anything better than this . To my surprise it works like butter and with the s pen working on it becomes a lot easier, even note taking on the tab is smooth"
5,"I'm using this tab for last 8 months and I'm very satisfied with it, battery works very well although charging is slow, pencil tip is working properly with no problem till now, camera quality is not very good, I purchased it in diwali sale so got it with good deal after using credit card, storage is also adequate so if you want to purchase a tab for studies or anything than go for it."
5,"It's an excellent product. It's size makes reading and viewing very comfortable. As it got a single sim facility, it's an added advantage to access mobile data when wifi is not accessible. Battery runs for long hours once charged. Samsung specific services are an added advantage. Overall very much satisfied with the product especially for study purposes, online classes, surfing etc."
5,Super fast delivery... very light weight tab. Many features and really useful for studies. Worth the money we pay. Go for it

5,"Excellent product. Display colors are very good. The battery on moderate use goes full day comfortably. The S pen is great and latency is very minimal. The sound is excellent with stereo speakers. The camera is average both front and back, needs improvement. Best for entertainment like movie music. Games like Asphalt, SBK16, Fifa, etc runs smoothly. Calling is fine but only on speakers and headsets. No earpiece. Overall excellent."

5,Clearly the best tab in this segment in every way!
5,Value for money device. Not suitable for intense gaming cuz of the exynos processor. But handles regularly multitasking without any major issues. The s pen is very well calibrated. Has awesome dual stereo speakers which sound loud and clear. Has stereo separation. Netflix/YouTube watching experience is great.
5,"Best tablet in this price. Much better compared to Ipad, as it has expandable storage, more access to apps ( android) and above all it has a S pen, which is absolutely free inside. Only downside is they give you charger which charges this tab completely in 3:30 hours."
5,A really good budget Tablet.
4,"It would be better if samsung would have provided extra S-Pen nibs as it wears out preety soon even with normal usage and nibs are not available in Indian market, so atleast flipkart should have S-Pen nibs for this tab as only S-pen was the reason I bought this."

Can go full day with single charge with heavy usage. Don't play games if you want it to stay longer and faster. Speakers are awesome. Camera ok ok. Better option than iPad in this range of price.

The only thing which disappointed me is that samsung doesn't provide fast charger with it but I already have it so it is okay. And ya last but not least it's speakers are mind blowing. I want to add it's image also but I am writing this review for tab itself so it is not possible."

5,Very slim and sleek design
5,The tablet is fantastic. However it lacks fingerprint sensor and I suppose the display is not as vivid as a super amoled display. Other than these two points I think the tablet is value for money.
4,Display is awesome. Pam rejection is so cool. Only one thing I don't like is some times few editing apps get hanging but Games are fine

Do study and office work u will be more than happy ."
5,"A wonderful product in budget. Display is fantastic. The best thing about tablet is the speakers by JBL, the sound quality is so good that you don't need an external speakers to play. Very much impressed by the design."

5,"Go for it of you don't play games much , light apps like the video streaming an all runs smoothly ,if you want perfect performance gor for IPad 8th or 7th otherwise this is the best. Audio is crazy loud and crisp , battery is really good and other features like the Google Assistant built in with ambient mode is nice and I guess you can watch Netflix in HD and other OTT too since Netflix was not by default installed. The display is cool and the adjustable stand and unique design stands apart n..."
5,"A compact tab with decent screen size. Build quality is sturdy and looks premium.

4,"I don't know from where are all the negative reviews about this tablet coming from...I have been using this product for about a week now and trust me, this tab is AWESOME...really....read books, watch videos or movies and believe me, the experience will be really great, unlike any other phone...talking about gaming, I am not much of a mobile gamer myself but considering the processor in this device, it is obvious the graphics won't be good...the battery performance is also not bad as other re..."
5,"Perfect for a student! Easy to use. I am rewriting the feedback after almost a month. There are a few applications included chrome which crash everything you open them. I have to install Microsoft edge for that and it is working better. There are a few pre-installed applications like google duo, google podcasts, google play music, etc. Which I never use and no option to uninstall them. This is space consuming."
5,"Best tablet in this price range. Elegant design, looks premium. Using it for last 1 week and its seems great. YouTube 1080p Full HD is also working perfectly. Best suited for basic daily uses like YouTube, browse news , e-books , pdfs etc. Sound quality is perfect and great."
4,"Review After two week If you are buying it for online classes. 1. Best in the range 2.big screen 3.good quality speakers 4.Can use sim and wifi 5.Expandable memory 6.Inbuilt stand is best thing 7.Camera is good  But 1.Battery backup is not so good.(1 day max) 2.Lags in Prepladder app. 3.Played COD not impressed, run on low settings.

Screen attracts finger print with no protection need to buy screen guard separately For some reason, some apps closes automatically which is no annoying!

5,With for money. Liked the product very much. Thanks to flipkart for timely delivery. I strongly recommend this product to all those who like a tab with gud sound quality. JBL speaker is awesome.
5,"Amazing team network, really didn't expected such fast & prompt delivery along with up-to-date updates. Overall my best wishes to all Flipkart Team. Satisfied about Lenovo Smart Yoga tab,"
5,"Its a good product.easy to handle . It has 1 disadvantage that it takes more time to charge around 3 hrs . All features are good after charging it runs for almost 14hr to complete die battery. Sound quality is super feels like we are in party or club. The new features ambient is cool..in less money it is very good quality product.i like this at most. It is perfect for study as well as movie, hearing songs."
4,"Smart Tab For Smart People. Literally a nice choice if your main purpose is just for entertainment like watching movies,videos playing games and internet surfing. I had been using this for now almost 15 days and till now overall good experience. Camera quality is just ok. Google assistant works well but I think if a stylus is provided with the tab it will be of great use."
5,I was looking for a tab with cellular option. When i searching for it felt apple is too costly. Later tried searching other options and found Lenovo Yoga Smart tab with google assistant and got impressed with design(stand is really great). Its light weight and easy to use JBL speaker cylinder is awesome. If you raise the volume full and keep it in hall center you will feel like theater(This is my first need because always listen to songs) Look at the configuration 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM extend...
5,"Good pick and happy that flipkart delivered the same much before the expected date of delivery.really happy for this nice gesture. Value for money, good performance.stunning look."
4,"Nice and affordable price, Lenovo with best configuration. smart and slim"
5,It's Wonderful and Battery life is very good.. Display color Quality must be bit more Good However it's quite okay but I think Battery life ig great almost 24 Hrs it's can work full use.. So in terms of Increasing battery life display quality has been bit kept low duw to post consumption factor.. It's best.
4,"Ignore the camera and you'll have a beautiful tablet in your hands. It charges slowly but battery backup is very very good. Performance is also very good and the screen size and display is outstanding. Looks very classy and stylish and a very good competition to ""unwantedly expensive"" brandsüòâ"
4,Very good product..it's value for money...so smoothly works & about to display is so brilliant results. But Battery is reducing so fast... I'm not satisfied with battery backup....
5,Its perfect for online meetings and classes. Good battery back up. Editing and other office work can be done easily Feels like a laptop.  And especially the sound quality üëåüëåüëå JBL speakers are awesome in this
3,"I bought it for 22k only to find prices went down to 20k a day later... This is completely unfair to customers. Hence the low rating.  Also camera could be better than 8MP at this price point. Phones have better camera below this price point so why are tablets an exception?  Battery will last only 6-7 hours on a full charge and moderate net surfing, so the claim of full day long lasting battery is a farce.  Sound quality is great though. That does not disappoint you."
5,All specifications sound display perfomance quality is too good than other tabs but camera lens and picture quality is not good as expected other tab and smart phones.its very dull picture quality. lenovo must improve lens quality and camera perfomance then in this range this Tab is superb.
5,Value For Money 3 months I have been used this tab...And then reviewing... its a best tablet and performance are good...camera also good and photo clarity looks decent. It's a best tablet in this price range..... Thank U Flipkart and Also Thank U LENOVO.....üíûüíûüíûüíûüíûüíû

5,"I was actually looking for a Tab for my grandson to be used for online classes. This one caught my attention due to it's specifications. It's being reviewed after 10 days of use.  This Lenovo Tab has got excellent features like Display, Touch response, Sound quality, Smooth task handling, Good battery backup and Built-in multi-position stand design. Additional advantage of Android 10 version over other Tabs available in this price segment. Besides, I would like to mention that fast charging ..."
5,Excellent battery backup with great display. Good for writing and reading. Sound is very clear and loud enough like a JBL bluetooth speaker. Just back camera is not good but front camera is good enough for video calls. Processor is fast enough for study purpose though i have not tried games. Overall value of money.
5,This is one of the best tab in this budget and for your kids and online classes. It provides parent control system for usage and downloads. Very good speaker and also mic which catches sound very clear. The stand given behind the screen is very much useful and provide ease to keep Safely.  Over all its a best product depends on your purpose and usage.
4,"Great tablet. Sound quality is fantastic, this is especially absent in other tabs. Display Is crisp. The stand is an added value. RAM and processing power is ample for videos. No idea about gaming though. overall a satisfying purchase."
5,"Possibly one of the best tablet in the market. If you are looking for a tab which can be used for studying purpose or attending the online classes, this is totally for you. The processor is a bit outdated so it is strictly for those who need it for watching some videos, studying and attending online classes. The jbl speakers works amazing. It has good battery which last around a 2 days."
4,"Handy,Smart and Flexible Product.Design and Display is very good.Camera quality can be better but still having Wifi and 4G LTE in this price made it master in the category."
5,Vey nice product . Go for it without a second thought. Excellent for students. Worth every penny spent. Loved it. And excellent service and fast delivery by Amazon.
4,"I liked this product, do not expect performance of a laptop, but in all other respects worth for the money we pay, no hesitation in recommending this product for an average user. Packing by Flipkart not good at all ."
5,"It's a very reliable and user friendly device. Very handy, stylish... Just not getting a good compatible cover for it."
5,This is a amazing product to use for online classes editing office work super good thing to use for those things its not suitable for playing pubgy or any game beacuse its screen is so big to catch so...

5,Vey nice .. at this price with goggle assistant features
1,The tab is said to have 4GB ram but it doesn't work like that we are using it for kids studying and the tab gets hanging continuously there is nothing installed in the tab. its brand new but still hangs a lot. please don't buy it
1,It's switches off frequently. If it continues to do so thn it's a waste of money.
3,The battery is not up to the mark as shown in the website. After 1-2 hours of online class the battery drains from 100-70 %. My previous mobile was giving better battery backup as compared to this one. Performance is ok but it often hangs during online classes which is not a good sign. I will recommend to buy any other ipad but if you have a budget than you can definitely go for this one. And also as per the website the tab should be android 10 but it is actually 9. Sound quality is beast. Ov...
5,Awesome product Performance is good
5,"I can better tell the experience because I also have Google Nexus Tablet and also Microsoft Tablet, I was in dilemma regarding buying a great tablet and my requirement ended with Lenovo, in this range it is the best tablet, also camera and overall performance is great. Build is firm and sound quality is superb. And you can feel it."
5,Too good product
5,Simply wonderful!
4,"Using this tab for a week now. Half the apps ain't working on this tab, even apps like hotstar lags. Even my 2 years old Mi note 5pro works faster without lagging. My bad luck the return policy ended yesterday. I felt cheated by reviews and flipkart."
5,It's values for money
5,V good
2,Hang problem... Suddenly screen stop... Suddenly lock...
5,Tab is working very good..but the pack was not sealed .it was totally open when I got this!!! Only the tab was sealed with it's plastic rap.but its OK as the tab is awesome.
2,Reviewing after a month usage.....ok perfomance
1,"This is Worst Ever TABLET , I purchased to many lags in Display , Display Turns Black out Automatically When I raised request to replacement , I recieved replaced new same tab but same and more problems I faced but that Time No Replacement and Refund Help I got by Flipkart and I am Flipkart Plus Member Guys If You wants to waste your money in this tab pls avoid it. its Really Waste Product I ever seen I have Recordings of issues also"
5,Excellent product
1,Waste one flipkart cheating wasted my money
2,I am using this tablet for past 2 months. For 1 month it was working fine. Now its getting hang while we do working on some documents. And the battery also drain so easily. Its not at all worth for money. Performance wil be good in the beginning month then issues start
3,Very Bad Bad charging time Its taking 10 to 11 hours full charge Battery it very Bad also i think only 7 to 8 hours internet time continue use and movie 9-10 hours something (everything i say on full charging) I don't know how people gave good rate for battery. I am not satisfied with Battery and Charging time Other performance just ok not more good. its my genuine Rate Nothing is fake and nothing is for misguide
1,So bad thing
4,Good
4,Ok
3,"Display is good. Sound is good Performance is okay. Suddenly freezes and restarts on its own.  Haven't dropped the TAB yet, can't say anything about the durability. However be sure of not dropping it at all as the built is very fragile.  Overall, not worth the price. But not a bad option either."

4,"This product is nice but while I do my online classes it little bit hang and also it sometimes hang, and we have to do Retrain the Assistant to recognise your voice for Ok Google or Hey Google after one week again."
1,I got it exchanged my old phone and the thing is that the delivery guy who picked up the phone said. Tbere is a small dent and took extra money from my parents.. Flipkart is a bigtime fraud
2,Looking good but performance is very bad android version is backdated Lenevo should upgrade its android version with latest
5,NICE PRODUCT FOR GAMING. AND FOR STUDIES.  DON'T THINK BUY HURRY.
5,My daughter is now happily attending her online classes
2,"Don't buy because You will be frustrated due to hanging . 1st time while looking and touching tab, I feel very nice and very pleasant but while using I understood what is the actual problem. 4GB RAM working as 2GB. I understand that they are misleading us by providing JBL speaker combination with Dolby atoms. I don't think so put 20k for this combination."
3,"It's start hanging just after 9 day,s of use"
1,Very bad product. The tab is lacking too much
4,It's really awesome.  Please don't buy any product with exchange.  Flipkart exchange is fake.
2,"Unable to use in outdoor No OS update, No upgrade to Android 11 The issue with Microsoft Tem, we can hear the sound after closing the app. Restart required Irritating camera position Very fewer features  Disappointed"
5,"Lenovo Yoga Tab is awesome for students doing online classes, performance is terrific,Display is superb,JBL speakers with Dolby Digital sound very good, Battery backup is decent,Stand make this tab unique as no other brand is providing except Lenovo, , watching Movies and doing day to day jobs are breeze ,I don't play Games ,so no comments on that aspect,Guys simply go for it.

3,Not easy to handle - Heavy on speaker lining side. Old processor. Not worth of Price

4,I would have given 5 stars but outer cover ws totally damaged No doubt the tab is beautiful and sounds great

5,Lenovo yoga tablet is a wonderful tablet. Must buy. According to me it is better than Samsung and Huawei. Pros---- Hang Free. Respond immediately. Suitable for online class. Battery life is also the best. And looks just wow.  Cons--- Not for gaming. Take 2 hours for charging.
5,Terrific... must buy... value for money... i love it... my son also happy...
1,Worst purchase on flipkart. Just one month old. The tab is switching off regularly... It was purchased for the online class. Useless. It is disturbing the class as it goes off. How can you sell fake products for such a huge price... Lossing my trust in flipkart gadgets.
5,Nice backup good sound and display also speed awsome
5,Nice product
5,Was a bit worried when I was purchasing this product cause of the hanging issue highlighted in the reviews. Am glad I bought this one as this is for by daughters schooling purpose and this takes care of all the necessary activities. Been using it now for a week and didn't freeze up even a single time..looks good to me. Sound output is good not superb..will start breaking up as soon as you raise the volume.

5,very good product
5,"Value for money, amazing sound quality. Camera is ok but overall performance is good."
1,Not at all very good product and we can not trust on Flipkart it says that The tab is Android 10 but it is android 9
5,"Excellent Product. It is very helpful for Kids in online classes, indoor entertainment cartoons, educational tools etc. It's fabulous. But it should have more Memory for storage ."
5,Very super produduct specilly its physical apperiance sexy
5,Cool product
1,Within 13 days the wifi in this tab stop connecting.
1,Connectivity is worst... And tab also restarting frequently

5,Great for sound. I have bought for my son's online classes and am fully satisfied. Tab looks great
4,Look wise it is awesome..but performance is not good and charging speed is quite slow..
1,Very bad performance always hang I will try many times restart but no results. Without file and documents I use but no work always hang my money is waste.
5,Excellent. Delivered in 24 hrs. The product is good as expected
3,"Battery drains Very fast. And it's taking more time for charging again. Expected fast charger adapter, But here Lenova given normal charger. Battery is not good for KIDS online classes who is having more than 4 hours class continuously.."
2,Worst touchscreen experience. Not worth buying.
3,Many software stops automatically.
5,Best to purchase but not use for ear phone
5,Perfect buy...
5,Value for money .(Flipkart need to improve your product packing .
5,wide screen.Faster processor.classy looks and reasonable price

5,I purchased this Tab by Flipcart Sooper and Excellence service. Good Battery pickup. Good Quality camera. Every thing sooper
5,A very nice product. Strongly recommended.
3,"Performance is slow, apps taking time to get open. Display and touch are average."
5,Worth money... Sound quality is awesome
2,For a month it worked well then it shuts up automatically and restart... This is continously problem... Using only 2Gb RAM... Any solution
1,Bad display
1,Dont buy this product ...i brought this product on 11 jan...i have got a defective piece..i have to factory reset the tab every time as my tab goes blank in between...when contacted they say to factory reset.i have factory reset it for 7 to 8 times every time new problem arises and screen goes blank
3,Heavy in weight. Only stand is the reason it stands out! JBL speaker is cool but adds width to overall design needlessly. Battery charges too slowly and drains slowly too. Good for movie/songs/entertainment/social media. Not so good for any other purposes. It is almost like a mobile with large screen.
1,Don't buy software not gud hanging continuously
1,"Dont buy,, expensive and worst charging capacity and Bluetooth is stopped immediately and wifi connectivity is too poor"
1,Hang hang
1,"Highly hanging problem, works just like 2 GB RAM & 16 GB ROM instead of 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM.. Very poor performance... Don't buy this one & also Lenovo Tab"

1,Very bad not returning the product
2,Microphone is not good. And mouse cursor isn't good. No stylus seems to be available in the market for this tab.

1,Don't buy for gaming
2,Very poor battery backup.takes 6 hours to charge 1000%

Convenient for reading news and other information.  Only the minor problem.. we cant hold on our hand in portrait position to read text, requires a stand or holder.  One more drawback is.. The on off button and volume button will become abticle to hold the tablet on surface in portrait position. The resting back clip is usefull only ..."
